            <p>Welcome to my little slice of the web!</p>
            <p>Quite a few years ago <a href="https://micro.alochana.net/@lohang">@lohang@micro.alochana.net</a> and I
                were in a conversation somewhere in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>
                and the gist of the conversation was that "x, y, and z need to happen then social media will be a better
                place to be." I was in a rather snarky mood that day and said something akin to "what needs to happen is
                that everyone needs to go back to having personal websites, reading each other via RSS feeds, and
                communicating via email. Then the whole internet will be full of fairy dust and unicorn farts." Or at
                least something similar to that.</p>
            <p>It took me a couple of years to reach the point where I finally got a gutfull of the parasocial networks
                and decided to do something about it. I ragequit a bunch of my social media accounts and I learned how to
                build a page on Github and began building what I thought was a a website.</p>
            <p>Well I was a little wrong in what I was building. I was building a blog not a website. A blog is an
                online diary not a website. And I am the kind of guy who doesn't find the details of my life to be
                particularly interesting so I have no clue why anyone else would want to read what I was writing. So
                after the initial excitement of building the site and posting a few items this site fell into the
                doldrums and pretty much ceased to exist.</p>
            <p>Somewhere along the line I bumped into <a
                    href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/">How Blogs Broke the Web</a> and that
                opened up a whole slew of thoughts and ideas and led me to a concept known as <a
                    href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens.</a> The idea is not new at all. It
                is the way the internet was back in the early days of the worldwideweb. Goodness, back then we all had
                pages on Geocities and other places of similar ilk. Social media conformity? We never heard of that back
                then. We all did out own thing and we did it proudly. If you didn't like a site you didn't have to go
                look at it.</p>
            <p>Oh how I miss those days!</p>
            <p>Well, long story longer, I have decided that this "blog" site is going the way of the dodo. Sure, there
                will be a "blog" section but I am more interested in creating a small space online that is distinctly me
                and about stuff that interests me. I am tired of being told what to think and what to like.</p>
            <p>There will be a bunch of different topics. I make no promises as to what will be here. I can tell you
                there will be a "tech" section, and a blog. I will probably include some stuff about my woodworking. Who
                knows? That is the fun of a digital garden, it is about everything and nothing all at once.</p>
            <h3>Some small details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="mailto://ragamuffinjim@gmail.com">Email</a> is my preferred method of online communication.
                    I do have GPG keys for
                    this email address for the privacy conscious.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Oddly enough if you click the link for the <a href="http://ragamuffinijim.github.io/rss.xml">RSS
                        Feed</a> in a browser you will get bupkiss but if you enter it into a feed reader it works.</li>
                <br>
                <li>While I am not on parasocial media very often I do use an account on <a
                        href="https://mastodon.social/@ragamuffinjim">Mastodon.</a></li>
                <br>
                <li>I do not want, collect, or save any of your personal information except your email address if you
                    wish to correspond with me.</li>
                <li></li>
