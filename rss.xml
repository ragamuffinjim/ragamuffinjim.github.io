<description><![CDATA[<h2>Site Changes</h2>
            <!-- <h3>Main Stuff</h3> -->
            <!-- <h4>Main Stuff</h4> -->
            <!-- <h5>Main Stuff</h5> -->
            <!-- <h6>Main Stuff</h6> -->

        <p>Life finally slowed down enough for me to spend some time on this site and get it out to the world. Truth is, that I probably had plenty of time to work on this site but I got sidetracked by other shiny toys like <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">Mastodon</a>.</p>
            
        <h3>Site Hosted on Github</h3>

        <p>I finally made a decision and put this site on the air! Yes, if you read some of the older posts on here you will discover that I wanted to avoid entanglements with evil comapnies in the big-tech world and wanted to host this on a server sitting on my desk at home. I still do.</p>

        <p>However, I simply do not have the time to mess with that right now. I wanted to get on with my experiment in simpler internetting and even simpler computing. I do not have to leave my text editor to post directly to github.</p>

        <p>I can hear a ton of people screaming in the background screaming about github now being owned by Microsoft. I know, I know, but really! I am a fat, half-deaf, half-blind guy approaching old age. I am a joke as a computer hacker or political malcontent. What threat am I to anybody? It will not take them long to get bored watching me.</p>

        <h3>Gemini</h3>

        <p>To tell the truth, I really like the idea of Gemini. It is so simple and unadorned that it really is beautiful. It follows my basic idea of everyone having a webpage, an RSS feed, and an email. Gemini is also a quieter place than the WWW. It is a little more laid back. A little more like me.</p>

        <p>I would rather just use Gemini because it is fun to use and the people there are great but it requires a browser of it's own and it is not all that easy for people with negligible computer skills to use. I can not see many of the people that I know IRL ever joining the Gemini world. Most would rather be in Facebook land.</p>

        <p>I have decided to quit making things hard on myself and come back to WWW.</p>

<h3>Mastodon</h3>

<p>A very long time ago when I first got online I wanted to use the internet to become a famous writer. I did not understand how the "web" worked and kind of bounced around from one thing to another for quite a few years not really sure how to become famous online. Then the "social" media things appeared and I thought it was my ticket. I can put my writing in a blog and then use "social" media to promote it.</p>

<p>Well, in my case "social" media became it's own cause in my life. My writing took a backseat to the online presence which took over my life. I would spend hours just maintaining my "social" media presence and wrote nothing of any value. As "social" media grew more toxic I began to retreat from it. I dropped all the big named services a few years ago but kept a couple of the smaller and geekier versions of them.</p>

<p>One of those services was the Twitter-clone Mastodon. It has been a couple of years since I was very active on Mastodon. As I was getting this website online I thought, you know what, I need to post to my Mastodon posse that I am starting a website. I was thinking that doing that might get my website off to a good start and that I might be at least a little social online again.</p>

<p>I got up this morning and took a good long look at Mastodon and came to the conclusion that I do not need to be involved in that nonsense. It is chock full of politics, religion, and the batshit crazy. It might be worse than the big named "social" services out there.</p>

<h3>Back to Simplicity</h3>

<p>So I am going back to the original idea of a webpage, an RSS feed, and email as a social platform.</p>]]>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>About</h2>
            <!-- <h3>Main Stuff</h3> -->
            <!-- <h4>Main Stuff</h4> -->
            <!-- <h5>Main Stuff</h5> -->
            <!-- <h6>Main Stuff</h6> -->

            <article>
                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p> The other day I wrote a rather long rant that was about the reasons why I am doing this. Upon
                    rereading it last night I came to the conclusion that it really is incoherent drivel. So I am
                    rewriting it right now. For those that happened to see the pre-production of this I apologize for
                    this but I need to write something better.</p>
                <h3>Main Event</h3>

                <p>The dream that was the internet has died. The internet was dreamed up to be a nuclear war proof
                    communication system for the government that was decentralized. Even if one node went down it would
                    still work. Civilians got ahold of it and added to the dream. The internet became not only a
                    decentralized communications network but a haven for democracy, openness, and some creativity. </p>

                <p>The internet operated that way for quite a few years. Slowly but surely, a few tech companies began
                    to realize the potential of monetizing the net. This too began to happen. In time a few big tech
                    companies essentially seized control of the internet and the web and transformed it into a
                    centralized totalitarian state with few freedoms.</p>

                <p>This web site is a protest against that.</p>

                <p>Several years ago I was talking with a friend and he said that "X, Y, and Z should happen and then
                    everything will be roses and unicorn farts. I was in a snarky mood that day and said something to
                    the effect that what needed to happen was that everyone needed to get a personal website, use RSS to
                    follow each other, and use email for communication and file transfers. Then, I said, everything will
                    be roses and unicorn farts.</p>

                <p>It took me a few years to realize the beauty of my snarky comment. It took me a while to see that it
                    was a decentralized system and that it was democratic, open, and would allow for creativity. Now I
                    am a believer and am putting my mouth where my money is.</p>

                <p>I will not try to explain all of the vision in this article. It will take me several articles to get
                    it all sorted out in my brain and written out for you. </p>

                <p>What you need to know for know is:

<title>Fonts</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h3>Fonts</h3>
                <h6>Added <time datetime="2023-01-24">2023-01-24</time> </h6>

                <p>I learned a nifty little trick today. I have always though it would be a good idea to have the fonts
                    local. I kind of hate third party calls on the web. Somewhere in the back of my head I think that
                    everything pertaining to a webpage, like stylesheets, scripts, images, etc, should be on the local
                    device. You know, under the hood. A car doesn't need to send out for a carburetor after all. If it
                    did the car might be kind of on the slow side. I
                    might be wrong but I think this will speed up a page and maybe keep from pounding the internet so
                    hard. If that makes any sense.</p>

                <p>Anyway, the font for this page was found at <a
                        href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/glacial-indifference">Font Library.</a>
                    Yesterday, I noticed at the top right of the page that there was a download link for the fonts. Ok
                    COOL! Now what?!
                </p>

                <p>I ventured over to our beloved StackOverflow and found <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961721/how-do-i-install-a-custom-font-on-an-html-site">this
                        little
                        gem.</a></p>

                <p>Basically, all I did was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Download the zip file.</li>
                    <li>2. Created a "fonts" directory in the directory where my website lives</li>
                    <li>3. Unzip the downloaded file into the fonts directory</li>
                    <li>4. Added these lines to my CSS file (NOTE: the names and folder locations are specific to my
                        setup and fonts, probably not yours): <br>
                        <section class="code-block"> <code>@font-face {
                font-family: "GlacialIndifference";
                src: url('../fonts/GlacialIndifference/OTF/GlacialIndifference-Regular.otf');
                }
                <br>
                <br>
                @font-face {
                font-family: GlacialIndifference;
                font-weight: bold;
                src: url('../fonts/GlacialIndifference/OTF/GlacialIndifference-Bold.otf');
                }</code></section>
                    </li>
                    <li>5. Commented out the link in the header of my HTML file that allows the browser to go pick up
                        the font online.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After that, for grins and giggles I turned off the internet and checked to see if it worked. <em>IT
                        DID!</em></p>



                <p>I hace seen the "@something" tag in a couple of CSS files that I have perused but I didn't know what
                    it was for. Now I have a whole nuther rabbit hole Fonts]]>

<title>Day of Progress</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h3>A Day of Progress</h3>
                <h6>Added <time datetime="2023-01-22">2023-01-23</time> </h6>

                <p>Ok, so today has been a day of working on this webpage and I actually made some progress! I had a
                    glitch or two in my stylesheet that I couldn't figure out last night. Those issues are now resolved.
                    I also hated the way I had a pile of files meant to be this site so I got those organized in a way
                    that makes sense to me. Some minor league cosmetic things were changed along the way too.</p>

                <p>My big thing today though was learning a little about <abbr
                        title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and getting the feed written for this site.
                    Or, maybe I should say, written as far as the contents of this site will allow at this point.
                    Somewhere along the way I have written an RSS file before but it has been a long time. It is
                    actually much simpler than I remember and I now have a template for adding items to the feed.</p>

                <p>Every bit of this is being done by hand with a text editor. It is not that I am a glutton for
                    punishment, I want to do this the simplest way possible and I want to know all the ins-and-outs of
                    my own site. The text editor is the best way to do this. I should also add that this site lives on
                    my computer and is vetted before it is uploaded.</p>

                <p>This site will mostly consist of items that can be created and or manipulated in an editor. Because
                    this is a website it will only consist of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
                    </dfn> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript, <abbr
                        title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphic">SVG</abbr>
                    files.
                    HTML is the document itself. CSS files are used to make the document pretty. JavaScript is
                    programming language and is used for various purposes on a website. RSS is a way to distribute your
                    document without your readers having to view your site each day. SVG is a text created image.</p>

                <p>Easy peasy.</p>]]>
