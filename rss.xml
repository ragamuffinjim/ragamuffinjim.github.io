            <h2>Going back Old Skool</h2>
            <p><b>Posted:</b><time datetime="2025-08-17T16:47-5:00"> 2025-08-17 4:47 CDT</time>
                <br><b>Currently reading:</b> Death Come for the Archbishop by Willa Cather
                <br><b>Currently binging:</b> X-Files
                <br><b>Current music genre:</b> Fifty Shades movies soundtracks
            </p>
            <p>Truth is that this is just a test post to see if I can do something. Github has pissed me off in that it's runners or something don't work for crap and so my org-to-blog setup is not working on THEIR end and I am frankly sick of trying to figure out where it is broken there. It worked like a champ on my end. This is too complicated for what I am doing so I am going back to the templates and fill in the blanks set up that I used to use. Too hell with all of that other drivel.</p>
