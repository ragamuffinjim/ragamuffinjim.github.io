<description><![CDATA[<h3>Wonder Woman</h3>
            <p>Do you ever get to overpowering urge to smack some people upside the head and tell them to read a book
                once in a while? I have that urge just about every time I hear some one say something akin to "Back 40
                years ago we were more moral than today. The world is just falling apart." The merest hint of a phrase
                like that tells me that the person has NEVER read a book in their lives. They are claiming the moral
                high ground and yet they have obviously never read The Bible that they claim to cherish. By the by, for
                those who haven't partaken of the word, it is full of sex and violence and allusions to things we in
                polite society do not talk about.</p>
            <p>After watching the Gal Gadot movies in which she plays Wonder Woman I did a little bit of light reading
                on Wonder Woman. She was created by a dude named <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston">William Moulton Marston</a> in 1940. So
                we're talking 84 years ago. If people 40 years ago were more moral then twice that long back people
                must've been on the final step to heaven, right? Now Mr Moulton was married to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holloway_Marston">Elizabeth.</a> Now, the character
                Wonder Woman was based on a lady named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Byrne">Olive
                    Byrne,</a> who was their <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polyamorous"><i>polyamorous</i></a>
                life partner. William died in 1947 and Olive and
                Elizabeth continued living together until Olive died in 1990.</p>

            <p>Maybe I am a product of my time or something but as I read those those articles I am struck more by the
                fact
                that William died at the ripe old age of 54 than the polyamory. The women went on to live to 86 and 100.
                Hmm... makes a guy
                think that does.</p>

                <h3>Plain of Jars</h3>
            </a>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/PoJ-site_1-3.JPG/320px-PoJ-site_1-3.JPG"
                alt="Picture of a stone pot with a lid in The Plain of Jars World Heritage Site in Laos">
            <p>I got to looking at World Heritage Sites the other day. I have to admit a certain amount of
                American/Texan arrogance
                when I saw that the tiny county of Laos had three sites. How could such a tiny little country have so
                many sites? I
                thought to myself.</p>
            <p>Well, even though Laos is about the size of a thumbtack, it does give us a rather interesting World
                Heritage Site in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_of_Jars">Plain of Jars.</a> If I
                understand the story there is a huge field over in Laos that has a bajillion jars, like the one pictured
                above, all over the place. The eggheads have decided that these jars are where ancient folk buried their
                dead.</p>
            <p>Of course, I rather like the alternative explanation provided by legend of a race of giants occupying
                what we know of as Laos and these huge stone pots were for the making "huge amounts" of <i>"lau hai"</i>
                or rice wine.</p>

            <p>Now there is what is missing from the world- a race of giants getting smashed on homebrew!</p>

            </a>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2024-12-27">December 27,2024</time>
                <br>Currently reading: Nothing really
                <br>Currently binging: Stargate SG1
                <br>Current music genre: Mellow Contemporary Pop
            </p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> This is a work-in-progress. This page will be updated as I learn how to do this.</p>
            <p>Last Updated: 9:05 AM 6/9/2024</p>


            <p>Many people are impressed by folks who can print a page[^1] or that they can copy/paste,[^2]: or just
                about anything
                without the use of a mouse. For people who use the computer for hours everyday using a mouse seems less
                efficient than
                just typing in a couple of key commands and being done with it. For some, like yours truly, just trying
                to find the
                cursor in all this visual real estate can be a chore sometimes. So I have decided to find out if using
                the keyboard for
                what I do on a computer is any easier for me. I doubt it will speed me up in any substantive manner as I
                don't know very
                many of the commands and will have to use reference materials repeatedly throughout this experiment.</p>

            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>Also of note, this experiment will be done using the Windows side of this computer and not the Linux.
                From the little
                bit that I know the commands are probably the same in Mac and Linux but I can not guarantee this to be
                true.</p>
            <p>Emacs users, I am afraid you are on your own.</p>


            <h3>Stock apps</h3>
            <p>Also note that I want to use just the stock apps that came with Windows. So rather than apps that the
                cool kids would
                use, like VSCode and the Brave browser I will be using things like:

                <br>Microsoft Edge, web browser
                <br>Notepad, text editor
                <br>Windows Media Player
                <br>the on-board File Explorer
                <br>the on-board utilities, like calculator
            </p>
            <p>As I look at this list I realize that I am in for an education. I am not very familiar with the Media
                Player or Edge. I
                haven't been a Windows user since 2006 so this may be a fun project just in that regard.</p>


            <h3>Mouse Pointer</h3>
            <p>As a pro-tip take a look at How to control the mouse pointer in Windows 10 and follow it. Sometimes you
                may need a mouse
                pointer.</p>
            <p>The page says Windows 10 but it works on my Windows 11 box as well.</p>

            <h3>Let's get started</h3>
            <h4>Opening an app</h4>
            <p>In order for me to learn what to do I need to learn while doing it. I already have my computer booted up
                and Notepad is
                open. I am typing this out on Notepad already. Because this is one of my first times to do this sort of
                thing I need to
                open up a cheat sheet or three so that I can navigate around the computer in general and the app in
                particular. So I
                guess it might be a good idea to open Edge.</p>
            <p>Simple enough- press the Windows key and when it opens up type in Edge, the press Enter. Et voila! Edge
                opens up.</p>
            <h4>Putting the window where you want it</h4>

            <p>You can move the window wherever you want it in your visual real estate by pressing the Windows key and
                using the arrow
                keys. This is easy enough. Easy enough on my setup with two monitors too. Just cycle through until you
                find the setup
                you like.</p>

            <h4>Ok Edge is open, now what?</h4>

            <p>If you already have something open on your computer, like I have Notepad up and running you can use
                Alt+Tab to select
                which window you want to work in. I used this and selected my newly opened Edge window.</p>
            <p>Once there, I discovered that Edge doesn't open automagically with the search bar active so I typed Alt+d
                to activate
                the search bar. I typed in “windows keyboard commands” and hit enter. Edge took me to Bing (of course)
                and the very
                first item in the search results was “Help from Microsoft.” Let me scroll down using the tab key and see
                if I can select
                that one.</p>

            <p>Ok, the tab button worked, but I couldn't see where I was on the screen and it was just doing stuff so I
                am going to try
                scrolling down with the arrow keys and select my link that way...</p>


            <p>And we easily found and clicked our page. Keyboard shortcuts in Windows. I got that link by going back to
                Edge using
                Alt+Tab and when I got there I used Alt+d to get in the address bar and then hit Ctrl+c to copy the
                link. Upon returning
                to Notepad I simply pasted the link address into the link above.</p>
            <h4>Need a new tab in Edge</h4>
            <p>For this part of the experiment I want to have three tabs open in Edge all the time. One for Windows
                keyboard shortcuts,
                another for Edge shortcuts, and yet another for a page last night that lists keyboard shortcuts for
                several different
                Microsoft apps.</p>
            <p>Now I am unfamiliar with Edge, but I do know that Edge is based on Google Chrome. In Chrome Ctrl+t will
                open a new tab.
                Let's see if that works. Ok, that worked and I managed to get Keyboard shortcuts for Edge and Keyboard
                Shortcuts in apps
                opened so that I have my reference material open while I do stuff here for fun.</p>
            <h4>Notepad</h4>

            <p>Oddly enough, in this world of fancified text editors, when I just need a text editor and not all the
                bull@#$% attached
                to a beast like VSCode I like to find the dumbest text editor that I can. I am talking about stuff like
                Nano, Gedit,
                Leafpad, and Notepad. One can get all twisted off and running down rabbit trails messing with all of
                that fluff.
                Sometimes, most of the time?, all that I need is a typewriter on a screen not a mini-os that can control
                satellites.</p>

            <h4>Keyboard shortcuts in Notepad</h4>

            <p>Ctrl+c, Ctrl+x, Ctrl+v, Ctrl+f, all work as expected in Notepad.</p>
            <p>Ctrl+left-arrow and Ctrl+right-arrow move the cursor forward or backward by word.</p>
            <p>Ctrl+home moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. Ctrl+end moves it to the end of the line.</p>

            <p>Once you move the cursor to the beginning of a word you can use the Ctrl+Shift+right-arrow or
                Ctrl+Shift+left-arrow to
                select the text you want to copy. Ctrl+c copies, Ctrl+x cuts, Ctrl+v pastes the selection where the
                cursor is.</p>

            <p>Notepad has a feature that let's one add a time stamp to the text file. Just press F5 and you have a
                timestamp. I am
                nowhere near done with this right now but the time is 9:00 AM 6/9/2024</p>




            [^1]: This would be CTRL + p.
            [^2]: CTRL + c to copy, CTRL + x to cut, CTRL + v to paste.
            <p></p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Some James Bond Minutiae</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-11-01"> 2023-11-01</time>
                <br><b>Currently reading:</b> Lindbergh by A. Scott Berg
                <br><b>Currently binging:</b> James Bond movies
                <br><b>Current music genre:</b> Contemporary Christian Music (of all things)
            </p>
            <p>So for those that have been paying attention to the little statusy things above I have been binging out
                on James Bond movies. It is all that the "TV" watching lately, or at least the watching that I have been
                paying attention to anyway. I have seen all of them before, of course. My kid bought me a box set of all
                of them a few years ago. I am just working my way through them in order again.</p>

            <p>The first three of the Bond series are great. Those are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._No_(film)">Dr. No</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(film)">From Russia With Love</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)">Goldfinger</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These all star Sean Connery in the role of James Bond. They are great movies and have some of the
                prettiest Bond girls. I am kind of meh about the rest of the Connery Bond movies. Thunderball was ok,
                You Only Live Twice a little less than that, and Diamonds are Forever borders on being a disappointment.
            </p>

            <p>George Lazenby stars as Bond in <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_(film)">On Her Majesty's
                    Secret Service.</a> The Bond Girl in this one was the one and only <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Rigg">Diana Rigg,</a> HUBBAHUBBA! This movie generally
                gets panned by fans of the series. Upon my last few viewings of this one I have come to believe that the
                reason for the panning is because Lazenby is not Connery more than anything else. It really is a good
                movie with a decent plot and all the actors do a very good job in it, notably Telly Savalas as Blofeld.
            </p>

            <p>Sir Roger Moore started as 007 in 1973. He was Bond for 12 years which was longer than any other Bond. He
                also starred in seven Bond movies which was more than any other Bond. But, out of those seven only the
                only good ones are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(film)">Live and Let Die</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(film)">The Spy Who Love Me</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In the Moore era I give a grudging nod to For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy as being OK but The Man with
                the Golden Gun, Moonraker, and A View to a Kill were just dumb.</p>

            <p>Timothy Dalton's era as Bond only produced two movies. Neither of what I would call good but of the two
                Living Daylights is the better. Neither of these is necessarily Dalton's fault. I can see where he was
                going with Bond but the productions were simply junk with bad scripts, bad acting, and overall poorer
                quality than any other Bond productions.</p>

            <p>Pierce Brosnan was the next Bond. As a general rule his Bond is nothing more than a smart-ass that I
                generally don't care for. In truth however, the movies were fun. They were all good except for Die
                Another Day where Brosnan's Bond was just too damned much to bear for me.</p>

            <p>Daniel Craig was the last Bond so far. His five were all good. They were action packed and had damned
                fine character development. The only one that lagged for me was Quantum of Solace and that was that bad
                of a lag.</p>

            <p><b>THE QUESTION EVERYONE ASKS:</b></p>
            <p><i>Which is your favourite Bond?</i> It is not a cop-out really but my favourite Bond is the one the one
                in the Fleming books. ;-)</p>

            <p><b>Posted:</b><time datetime="2023-10-29"> 29 October 2023</time>
                <br><b>Currently reading:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbergh_(book)">Lindbergh</a>  by A. Acott Berg
                <br><b>Currently binging:</b> Still on James Bond movies
                <br><b>Current music genre:</b> Bluegrass
            </p>
            <h3>Got Cold Here</h3>
            <p>Just all of a sudden it got cold and rainy here. We were sunny and in the 70s on Friday and Saturday and right now we are at 37 and rainy. I really don't mind winter weather but the sudden shift in temps is kind of jarring to my body anymore. I guess that I am too old for it. My joints are aching something severe today.</p>

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>Friday night I went to bed about 10PM and woke up around 9AM on Saturday. Saturday night I went to bed around 11PM and I woke up this morning at 10:46AM. About an hour an half ago I laid down and took a nap and just woke up a few minutes ago because my shoulder hurt. The only other times in my life I have gotten that much sleep in so short a time I have been sick with something.</p>

            <p>I must be more exhausted than I thought. There is a lot of chaos in my professional life with the potential sale of my workplace and that is worrying me. I also have a few things that need to change in my personal life that are causing me some anxiety.</p>

            <p>I guess I needed the rest but I kind of feel like a zombie today.</p>

            <h3>Looking to change how this page works</h3>
            
            <p>I think that I would really like to change how this website works. What I envision is writing an article in Markdown, uploading it to github, and have the thing automagically appear somewhere else as this website. Is there some sort of app/program/gadget that can do this?</p>

            <h3>Changed my mind... again</h3>

            <p>Another couple of days last week playing around on Mastodon proved to me futility of playing around too much there. I will check in and see if my friends are trying to get in contact with me and the feed for this site should bounce over there in time but other than that I am pretty much done with it. It is just too much like any other social media site now. </p>

            <p>I think that pretty much covers today's news. I am kind of groggy and out of it and can't think of anything else that needs to be said for now. Thank y'all for stopping by and feel free to comment with the "Reply via Email" button below.</p>

            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-10-24">2023-10-24</time>
                <br>Currently reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)">A Beautiful

                <br>Current music genre: Coffeehouse
            </p>
            <p>Finally, after several months of threatening to do so I have cleaned out the feed reader of all politics, philosophy, religion and other associated fluff. I still follow the feeds for some of the products that I use and a couple of the bigger "commercial-type" feeds that I have been following for many years now.</p>

            <p>After cleaning out the feed I scoured the folks I follow on Mastodon looking for the blogs of my already friends and found a couple of other feeds that look sort of interesting. I am still on a quest for other interesting feeds. I am really interested in personal blogs. You know the ones where people talk about whatever or whatever is going on in their lives. The whole "let me promote my own agenda" blogs are too much for me these days. I like things to be quieter and more real. It is more important for me to hear about a person taking their three year old to the barber (a real blog post I read last Sunday) than to read an opinion about some war or some politician. </p>

            <p>I found out that there is a name for those of us who more or less reject social media and keep websites, use RSS, and communicate by email. I was thinking I would call it "old skool" internetting but, seemingly, the hashtag #smolweb applies to this. So I guess that I am a smolwebber? That looks silly in print.</p>

            <p>If that is what I am in then so be it. I am enjoying the quiet and the honesty and the reality of the so-called smolweb.

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Simple Times</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-10-22"> 2023-10-22</time>
                <br>Currently reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)">A Beautiful
                    Mind</a> by Sylvia Nasar
                <br>Currently binging: James Bond movies
            </p>
            <p>So the other day I signed into an old Mastodon account that I never got around to deleting in my
                rage-quitting against (anti)social media a few months ago. It is actually getting to be fun now that I
                have eliminated all the people who have nothing but
                news/politics/religion/sexual-orientation/some-other-bullshit-idealistic reason for being on social
                media. It is nice to pare down the timeline to where it is people talking to people. I may stick around
                for a while. I was missing some of these folks and want to stay in touch.</p>

            <p>Parenthetically, after a disappointing day yesterday of trying to do something different with how I make
                this blog and RSS feed, I have decided that I will just keep doing what I am doing. It is easy and
                comfortable, kind of like and old shoe. After getting very little actually accomplished yesterday,
                except for the headache that comes from trying to relearn <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs">Emacs</a> and all of it's weirdness, I decided that
                what I was doing is working just fine and I will keep doing it.</p>

            <p>I will keep doing it the way I have been doing it with one or two provisos, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>- I will play in (anti)social media a little more with some very tight rules for me to follow.
                    (Manifesto coming soon)</li>
                <li>- I will clean out my RSS feed reader of the news and political stuff.</li>
                <li>- I will focus more on people in both my feed reader and social media accounts, and</li>
                <li>- I will actually take the time to turn this blog into something.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>I have also set a doohickey (please pardon the technical term) for sending the feed for this site to my
                Mastodon timeline. I found one person's blog through this sort of setup the other day and I really
                enjoyed his post. It was just a personal post about taking his kid to the barber. Nice, clean, simple,
                personal, and real.</p>

            <p><u>Nice, clean, simple, personal, and real.</u> Yeah, that is the internet that I want to be a part of.
                That is the internet that I want to see. That is the internet that I am, hopefully, helping to create.
            </p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Updates</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-08-26">2023-08-26</time>
                <br>Currently reading: The Bible KJV
                <br>Currently binging: Nothing really, maybe crappy action movies
            </p>
            <p>It is hard to believe that the entire month of August has passed me by and I have not made a single
                update to this site. My life is in the midst of some serious chaos right now and I am having a tough
                time getting the swarm of information and changes processed and put in it's proper place. Some big big
                changes. I am kind of excited by some of aspects of it and terrified by other aspects of it. I might
                provide some details about the life changes happening as things get more concrete. Right now everything
                is imaginings and dreamland stuff.</p>

            <p>We spent the last week of July in southwestern Colorado. We had a good time. The weather was hot for that
                part of Colorado but was cool for us. We have spent nearly two months at temperatures of over 100
                degrees and a slight break from the heat was a blessing.
            </p>

            <p>I got another project in my mind for my furniture making hustle. An old timey album cabinet. I built
                something akin to this at work. It was a project that turned into a disaster. I think I figured out a
                way to make it better. In the near term I will be starting a side hustle where I hand build furniture
                out of wood and start selling it. Don't worry this site will not be all about me selling my wares. This
                will still be my personal-about-anything webpage. I may draw out the plans and have some videos or something
                of me building the stuff though.</p>

            <p>Other than that not too much else is going on. I'll start making a better website here. I need life to
                calm down a little bit so that I can focus a lot better. Right now I feel like my world has been dumped
                out of a box and into a frying pan but things will level out sooner or later. </p>

            <p>Y'all have a good day now...</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Shout Outs</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-07-16"> July 16, 2023</time>
            <br>Currently reading: Dune by Frank Herbert
            <br>Currently binging: Unxplained with Captain Kirk</p>
            <p>From time to time I get an email with some interesting comments and/or links that further some point that
                I made in some post. I plan to give them some acknowledgment when I found something they said or sent
                was particularly cool to me.</p>

                <h3>From b2e</h3>
            <p>Starting us off today is my friend b2e whom I met in the Fediverse world a few years ago. He sent me
                three or four links a couple of week ago by email. (I do read the emails and generally respond to them,
                even if it takes me a day or two to do so.) His first link was to <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/mastodon-servers.html">The
                    Experiences of People Running Mastodon Servers Suggests a Bumpy Road Ahead.</a> Now I did enjoy this
                article and it reenforces my thoughts about the "roll your own" movement within the various Fediverse
                factions. Namely, that it doesn't scale for poop and it will end up costing you a ton of money to run
                one. But tucked into the article is a little stat about the internet actually consuming roughly 10% of
                the world's electricity right now. Let that sink into your noggin for a minute. Maybe destroying the
                internet will be good for the environment.
                Second, on his list is <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/toxic-gardens.html">Finding "The
                    Internet" Toxic and Depressing? Consider Leaving Your Walled Garden.</a> The article is about what
                one would expect from the title. It is also why some of us chose to go the personal website route.
                Thirdly, b2e sent me a link to <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/resources.html"> The Cheapskates
                    links page.</a>I found a few neat things buried in there that were worth reading.

            </p>
<h3>from Starbreaker</h3>
            <p>Our new friend <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker,</a> click the link and read his book. I'll
                wait for you to get back... Go on, it is ok...</p>

            <p>Oh, you're back already? Great! Starbreaker sent me two link that were related to my post about the
                Unknown Warrior. Both links connect to the Arlington National Cemetery's website. The first is about<a
                    href=" https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Monuments-and-Memorials/Tomb-of-the-Unknown-Soldier">
                    the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier </a>and the second is specifically about the <a
                    href="https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore/Monuments-and-Memorials/Civil-War-Unknowns">Civil
                    War Unknowns.</a> Both were fascinating links and there are also some PDFs that can be downloaded
                and a video to watch if you so desire.</p>

                <h3>from Brad Taunt</h3>

                <p>The next one wasn't actually sent to me but I bumped into it, agreed with it and like it. <a href="https://bt.ht">Brad Taunt</a> has a personal website that is primarily about tech stuff and he has an article titled <a href="https://bt.ht/hamburgers">Stop Using Hamburger Menus (Sometimes)</a>. I love this article. One of the things I hate about 95% of the websites out there is that they all look the same like they were cutout with cookie cutters. Jimminey crimus! Do something different than a flipping hamburger menu with three dang grid boxes underneath it. Do something creative for crying out loud! Well, do not listen to me rant. Go read his. It is better than mine and I plan to implement his "Sitemap footer" idea as soon as I figure out if it is better looking than my "Sitemap header."</p>

<title>Having Nasty Thoughts</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Having Nasty Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2019-07-09"> July 9, 2023</time></p>
            <p>So for the past several weeks I have been working my feed reader for fun. I have been trying to find the
                right balance of sites to read. You know, not too many right-wing or left-wing politics. I've been
                trying to balance my news sources and trying to follow sites that post interesting articles from a
                variety of viewpoints.</p>

            <p>I've been trying to avoid the internet echo chamber and the slow creep of confirmation bias in the the
                stuff that I read. What I have ended up with is a bunch of sites that post a bunch of articles everyday
                that I am not really reading much more than the titles of.</p>

            <p>Since I have started this website I have discovered many people who like me use a website, RSS feed
                reader, and email as our social medium. Most of them seem to be like me and are tired of the social
                media world. They write personal websites and do not worry too much about the perpetual flame war that
                is social media these days. It is a redeaux of the internet of circa 1995. Slow, easy, organic, and
                simple.</p>

            <p>Today's nasty thought is to ditch all the detritus from my feed reader and only follow people that have
                adopted this internet social paradigm and the websites of products that I actually use or really believe
                in. This should slow things down enough for me to be able to keep up with the posts and keep me well
                informed about the stuff that matters.</p>

            <p>I haven't made a decision yet but I really am leaning more towards <b>slow, easy, organic, and simple</b>
                like I said above. Too much of the web is just insane and I (and probably you) want to take a small
                hiatus from the noise.</p>

<title>A Quick Update</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>A Quick Update</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-07-08"> 8 July 2023</time></p>
            <p>It has been a while since I have posted anything at all here. Life has been hectic, to put it mildly and just about all of my "internetting" has either been work related or over email/RSS the last few days.</p>
            <p>I have chosen ot implement a couple of changes on the site. I have added a "posted date" to the post. If I ever write a solution to a problem it might be a good idea to have a date on there so that people won't be looking at my post as a solution to a problem 15 years from now. Hat tip to <a href="kevq.uk">Kev Quirk</a> for this one. I also like Kev's "reply via email" link so I stole that one too. This will be a test post of that feature to see if I remember how to do it.</p>
            <p>I think I am going to change the "Other Tinkers and Thinkers" category on the <a href="../blog/02-links.html">links</a> page to the more traditional "Blogroll." I have added a couple of people into this Hall of Fame. Some of the other people that I read have blogrolls of their own and I am scouring their rolls for interesting people to follow and harass. </p>
            <p>Other than that I have no big thoughts today or at least not much that I want to take the time to write about yet. It has been a busy couple of months for me and hopefully things will slowdown to a dull roar soon. Then I hope to produce the content that I actually intended to for this site.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Found another tinker and thinker!!!</h2>

            <p>What a delight it was today to find <a href="https://kevq.uk">Kev Quirk's website.</a> A five star work
                that one! He'll be going on the links page for sure.</p>

            <p>Kev has a computer job in InfoSec but, like me he has a small holding and tries to live a country life.
                We call our's a homestead and we try to do the same thing.</p>

            <p>He is the creator of <a href="https://simplecss.org">SimpleCSS</a> which I have used a time or two on
                some webpages.</p>

            <p>He also shares my disgust with the current state of (anti)social media and has opted to do the same thing
                about it that I have, namely leave it mostly in the dirt.</p>

            <p>Kev's site is definitely going into the feed reader and he is going to get a cheerful email to boot.</p>

                origin,
                probably from
                Old Norse gá (“to watch, heed”) or gaurr (“rough fellow”) (Proto-Indo-European *gʰow-rós, from *gʰew-
                (“to
                be
                angry”)).</p>
            <h3>Adjective</h3>
            <p>garish (comparative more garish, superlative most garish)</p>
            <ul>

                </li>
                <li>Synonyms: gaudy
                    <em>The dress fits her well, but the pattern is rather garish.</em>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Semantic HTML Elements</h2>
            <p class="index-block">I am putting this here for my needs. Maybe the reader will find it useful. If not
                they can skip on ahead.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>The &lt;main&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs
                &lt;main&gt;</a>
            <p>The &lt;main&gt; HTML element represents the dominant content of the
                &lt;body&gt; of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or
                expands
                upon the
                central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</p>
            <p>A document mustn't have more than one
                &lt;main&gt; element that doesn't have the <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#attr-hidden">hidden</a>
                attribute specified.</p>
            <h3>The &lt;header&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;header&gt;</a>
            <p>The &lt;header&gt; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> element
                represents
                introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It
                may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
            </p>
            <h3>The &lt;section&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;section&gt;</a>
            <p>The &lt;section&gt; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML></a> element
                represents a
                generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific
                semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.</p>
            <p>To put this in Cracker-speak: This here acts just like a &lt;div&gt; so it is kind of redundant but it
                works
                better with a screen reader.</p>
            <h3>The &lt;nav&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;nav&gt;</a>
            <p>The
                &lt;nav&gt; HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links,
                either
                within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus,
                tables
                of contents, and indexes.</p>
            <h3>The &lt;footer&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;footer&gt;
                element</a>
            <p>The &lt;footer&gt; HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or
                sectioning
                root
                element. A &lt;footer&gt; typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data
                or
                links
                to related documents.</p>
            <h3>The &lt;article&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;article&gt;
                Element
            </a>
            <p>The &lt;article&gt; HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page,
                application, or
                site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples
                include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a
                user-submitted
                comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
            <p>A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each
                article
                one after
                another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an &lt;article&gt; element, possibly with
                one
                or more &lt;section&gt;
                s within.</p>
            <h3>The &lt;aside&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;aside&gt;
                Element</a>
            <p> The
                &lt;aside&gt; HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related
                to
                the
                document's
                main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>

            <h3>The &lt;summary&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;summary&gt;
                Element</a>
            <p>The &lt;summary&gt; HTML element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">&lt;details&gt;</a>
                element's
                disclosure box. Clicking
                the &lt;summary&gt; element toggles the state of the parent &lt;details&gt; element open and closed.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>You know what?</summary> Your Momma wears combat boots!
            </details>
            <h3>The &lt;time&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;time&gt;
                Element</a>
            <p> The &lt;time&gt; HTML element represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime
                attribute to
                translate dates
                into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as
                reminders.

            <ul>It may represent one of the following:
                <li>A time on a 24-hour clock.</li>
                <li>A precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).</li>
                <li>A valid time duration.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <aside>This part of this page is being written on <time datetime="2022-08-14T11:55:00">2022-08-14 at 11:55
                    AM.</time> You will not see anything in the text but a screen reader will love me. </aside>
            <h3>The &lt;figure&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure" class="linkspage2"> MDN web docs &lt;figure&gt;
                Element</a>
            <p> The &lt;figure&gt; HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption,
                which is specified
                using the &lt;figcaption&gt; element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a
                single
                unit.</p>
            <figure>

            <h3>The &lt;abbr&gt; Element</h3>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr" class="linkspage2">MDN web docs &lt;abbr&gt;
                Element</a>
            <p>The &lt;abbr&gt; HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.</p>
            <p>When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first
                use,
                along
                with the &lt;abbr&gt; to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or
                acronym
                means.</p>
            <p> The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full
                expansion
                is
                not present. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing
                all
                users what the abbreviation means. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing
                else.

                Element</a>
            <p>The &lt;data&gt; HTML element links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the
                content is time- or
                date-related, the &lt;time&gt; element must be used.</p>
            <h3>The &lt;mark&gt; Element</h3>

                Element</a>
            <p>The &lt;mark&gt; HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation
                purposes, due to the
                marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context.</p>

            <p>The &lt;cite&gt; HTML element is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include
                the
                title of that
                work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related

                <bold>A note for the
                    meticulous:</bold><i> Yes I know the image above is off-centered and I know it is not detailed or
                    anything. It
                    is the result of a couple of hours of experimenting, learning, and playing. I am tired and decided
                    to just show off
                    rather than redraw it again.</i>
            </p>
            <p>I spent a couple of hours today playing with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG"><abbr
                        title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr></a> file.
                For those of you who do not know, svg files are images that can be edited in a text editor. SVG files
                are crisp and
                clean at any scale. The file above was created in a text editor and in the original iteration was
                somewhere between
                50 and 75 lines of code. </p>
            <p>Originally, everything was plotted out by starting a line at a point and
                ending it at another point. Long, boring, tedious and mind numbing was that procedure. If I had to draft
                cabinet
                plans that way all the time I might have to quit my job or take up heavy drinking.</p>
            <p>A few months ago
                when I started learning about SVG, or at least the syntax of it, I discovered the <path> element. I also
                    discovered that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> is about as clear as mud on some
                    things.
                    While I did played around with <path> a few months ago I did not really understand much of what I
                        was
                        doing.</p>
            <p>I looked at my 60-odd lines of code today and said there simply has to be a better way to do
                this. So to Google I ventured and after a couple of other fruitless pages I found <a
                    href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-path-syntax-illustrated-guide/">this</a> wonderful page by Chris
                Coyier.
                About a 1/4 of the way down the page is a table that clearly explains in about 100 words what MDN
                couldn't explain
                in a few hundred words on their site.</p>
            <p>I experimented with <path> for a little while using the above
                    site as a reference. Low and behold one can use relative distances! I no longer need to go from
                    point x to point y
                    on every stinking line in the drawing. I can draw a whole plane relative to the point I started at.
                    That'll cut my
                    math down to NOTHING! </p>
            <p>At the end of it all today I probably can cut the time it takes to draw a
                cabinet in a text editor in half and my 60-odd lines of code was reduced to 24 lines AND 8 of those
                lines are
                comment lines and 2 more lines (the circles) are wholly unecessary. So, for what is in this picture
                there are only
                14 lines of code and that can be reduced as well.</p>
            <p>For those curious here is the code:
                <code class="code-block"><br>&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 232 232" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;<br>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Been Busy</h2>
            <p>This is a personal post and not really what I intend to write about but it is high time that I post
                something even if it is not what I plan for this website. I have been exceptionally busy the last couple
                of weeks.</p>
            <p>First, we had a family reunion down in Houston over Memorial Day weekend. For my non-US readers, Memorial
                Day is the last monday in May. It is holiday to honour our war dead. Houston is roughly an eight hour
                drive from our home. So, I had two days of driving out of a four day weekend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we had a couple of family members end up in the hospital after the holiday. They are fine now,
                or at least on the mend.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I bought a truck on my way home from the reunion. We had delivery plans for the truck but due to
                the hospital stays of family mentioned above those plans went kaput. We ended up flying to Houston,
                picking up the truck, and driving it back home in the space of 24 hours the very next weekend.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, my boss ended up going to the hospital for a grand total of eight days. So I was left in the
                dubious position of running the shop for a few days.</p>
            <p>And finally, I had a friend and mentor pass away this week.</p>
            <p>To say the least of it I have been very busy the last couple of weeks. I think things are calming down
                and I'll get back to keeping this up a little better.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Emetophobia</h2>
            <p>Ok, I really can not do a better job at this than the wikipedians so let me just quote some of their <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophobia">article:</a></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Emetophobia is a phobia that causes overwhelming, intense anxiety pertaining to vomit. This specific
                    phobia can also
                    include subcategories of what causes the anxiety, including a fear of vomiting or seeing others
                    vomit. Emetephobes
                    might also avoid the mentions of "barfing", vomiting, "throwing up", or "puking."</p>

                <p>It is common for those who suffer from emetophobia to be underweight or malnourished due to strict
                    diets and
                    restrictions they make for themselves. The thought of someone possibly vomiting can cause the phobic
                    person to engage in
                    extreme behaviors to escape from their anxiety triggers, e.g. going to great lengths to avoid
                    situations that could be
                    perceived as "threatening".</p>

                <p>Emetophobia is clinically considered an "elusive predicament" because limited research has been done
                    pertaining to it. The fear of vomiting receives little attention compared to other fears.</p>

                <p>The event of vomiting may make anyone with this peculiar phobia flee the scene. Some may fear other
                    people throwing up,
                    while others may fear themselves throwing up. Some may fear both. Some may have anxiety that makes
                    them feel as if they
                    will throw up when they actually might not. Other possible fears that may come with emetophobia is
                    not being able to
                    locate a restroom in a timely manner, not being able to stop throwing up, choking on vomit, being
                    embarrassed due to the
                    situation, or having to seek medical attention. People with emetophobia usually experience anxiety;
                    they often may
                    scream, cry, or if it is severe, pass out when someone or something has vomited.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The article goes on to show how emtophobia alters the lifestyle of the Emetophobes. Some have some
                complicated rituals like washing their food several times while they prepare it to avoid foodborne
                illnesses. As a result they do not go out to eat vey often.</p>

            <p>They are so afraid of vomit that they will not go to social situations where alcohol might be served. It
                says some women avoid pregnancy because they are afraid of the morning sickness of the first trimester.
            </p>

            <p>Wow, parenthood must be a bitch for these folks.</p>

<description><![CDATA[ <h2>The Debutante</h2>
            <p>Let me just say "Wow!" here. <a
                    href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Debutante-Audiobook/B0BV13NMBK?eac_link=OmB41KBjRfwK&ref=web_search_eac_asin_1&eac_selected_type=asin&eac_selected=B0BV13NMBK&qid=Yen6kSpLkq&eac_id=147-2266999-2520525_Yen6kSpLkq&sr=1-1">The
                    Debutante</a> is an Audible podcast by Jon Ronson. It is the story of a Tulsa debutante's fall from
                society to neo-naziism in the timeframe of the Oklahoma City Bombing. Carol Rowe, the debutante, was
                raised in the upper crust society of Tulsa Oklahoma and after high school she fell in with the wrong
                crowd and hung around with various high profile people in the white supremacist movement. She had ties
                to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim_City,_Oklahoma">Elohim City</a> and more than likely
                knew Timothy McVeigh prior to the OKC bombing.</p>

            <p>Somewhere along the way she became an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF)
                and may have provided the government with information of the planned terrorist act long before the
                events of 19 April 1995.</p>

            <p>Like everything in this type of study there are no definitive conclusions. She may have been a good guy
                acting like a bad guy to get info for the government. She may have been a bad guy stinging along
                everybody that ever came in contact with her. The ambiguity makes for good conspiracy theory copy.</p>

            <p>While I am not too sure what I think about Carol Rowe this story is engaging and was a great listen once
                I got used to Ronson's bizarre accent. Also, I learned quite a bit that I didn't know about the OKC
                Bombing. It is one of those free-to-members things on Audible so give it a listen.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>The Unknown Warrior</h2>
            <p>Yesterday I started listening to Stephen Fry's podcast <a
                    href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Stephen-Frys-Secrets-of-the-Roaring-20s-Podcast/B0BMHSFWCX?qid=1684596149&sr=1-18&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_18&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=FNCC5XQDXZ0GP7DCA6N2&pageLoadId=Lo68nwlyudEFBGIf&creativeId=0d6f6720-f41c-457e-a42b-8c8dceb62f2c">The
                    Secrets of the Roaring Twenties.</a> In the first episode of the series Fry with his usual
                tongue-in-cheek manner sets the stage for the series by providing an overview of the 1920's and most of
                what we think went on in the 20's was a result of the catastrophe of The Great War. I, for one, happen
                to believe that The Great War quite literally changed the world forever. Fry hits on this theme in
                tangentially and the starts telling stories that occured in the year 1920.</p>

            <p>After a couple of stories he went on to explain the origin of "The Unknown Warrior." Early in the war the
                military commands had decided to bury the dead where they died. It was not until after the war when
                families began requesting that the military retrieve the remains of their fallen husbands, sons, and
                brothers the the military realised that families needed closure. The entire nation was in mourning and
                did not have the comfort of having the remains or a funeral service.</p>

            <p>Retrieving the remains of all the fallen would have been a monumental task. One which a post-war United
                Kingdom was incapable of doing. Someone (I think Fry mentions a Reverend David Railton an Army chaplain)
                came up with the idea of retrieving one soldier's remains from a battlefield bringing him back to the UK
                and burying him and providing a closure for the nation.</p>

            <p>The entire process is detailed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unknown_Warrior">this
                    wikipedia article</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/unknown-warrior"> at the
                    Westminster Abbey site.</a> I will not even attempt to redo what is so beautifully written on these
                sites.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h2>Site Changes</h2>
            <!-- <h3>Main Stuff</h3> -->
            <!-- <h4>Main Stuff</h4> -->
            <!-- <h5>Main Stuff</h5> -->
            <!-- <h6>Main Stuff</h6> -->

        <p>Life finally slowed down enough for me to spend some time on this site and get it out to the world. Truth is, that I probably had plenty of time to work on this site but I got sidetracked by other shiny toys like <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">Mastodon</a>.</p>
            
        <h3>Site Hosted on Github</h3>

        <p>I finally made a decision and put this site on the air! Yes, if you read some of the older posts on here you will discover that I wanted to avoid entanglements with evil comapnies in the big-tech world and wanted to host this on a server sitting on my desk at home. I still do.</p>

        <p>However, I simply do not have the time to mess with that right now. I wanted to get on with my experiment in simpler internetting and even simpler computing. I do not have to leave my text editor to post directly to github.</p>

        <p>I can hear a ton of people screaming in the background screaming about github now being owned by Microsoft. I know, I know, but really! I am a fat, half-deaf, half-blind guy approaching old age. I am a joke as a computer hacker or political malcontent. What threat am I to anybody? It will not take them long to get bored watching me.</p>

        <h3>Gemini</h3>

        <p>To tell the truth, I really like the idea of Gemini. It is so simple and unadorned that it really is beautiful. It follows my basic idea of everyone having a webpage, an RSS feed, and an email. Gemini is also a quieter place than the WWW. It is a little more laid back. A little more like me.</p>

        <p>I would rather just use Gemini because it is fun to use and the people there are great but it requires a browser of it's own and it is not all that easy for people with negligible computer skills to use. I can not see many of the people that I know IRL ever joining the Gemini world. Most would rather be in Facebook land.</p>

        <p>I have decided to quit making things hard on myself and come back to WWW.</p>

<h3>Mastodon</h3>

<p>A very long time ago when I first got online I wanted to use the internet to become a famous writer. I did not understand how the "web" worked and kind of bounced around from one thing to another for quite a few years not really sure how to become famous online. Then the "social" media things appeared and I thought it was my ticket. I can put my writing in a blog and then use "social" media to promote it.</p>

<p>Well, in my case "social" media became it's own cause in my life. My writing took a backseat to the online presence which took over my life. I would spend hours just maintaining my "social" media presence and wrote nothing of any value. As "social" media grew more toxic I began to retreat from it. I dropped all the big named services a few years ago but kept a couple of the smaller and geekier versions of them.</p>

<p>One of those services was the Twitter-clone Mastodon. It has been a couple of years since I was very active on Mastodon. As I was getting this website online I thought, you know what, I need to post to my Mastodon posse that I am starting a website. I was thinking that doing that might get my website off to a good start and that I might be at least a little social online again.</p>

<p>I got up this morning and took a good long look at Mastodon and came to the conclusion that I do not need to be involved in that nonsense. It is chock full of politics, religion, and the batshit crazy. It might be worse than the big named "social" services out there.</p>

<h3>Back to Simplicity</h3>

<p>So I am going back to the original idea of a webpage, an RSS feed, and email as a social platform.</p>]]>

            <article>
                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p> The other day I wrote a rather long rant that was about the reasons why I am doing this. Upon
                    rereading it last night I came to the conclusion that it really is incoherent drivel. So I am
                    rewriting it right now. For those that happened to see the pre-production of this I apologize for
                    this but I need to write something better.</p>
                <h3>Main Event</h3>

                <p>The dream that was the internet has died. The internet was dreamed up to be a nuclear war proof
                    communication system for the government that was decentralized. Even if one node went down it would
                    still work. Civilians got ahold of it and added to the dream. The internet became not only a
                    decentralized communications network but a haven for democracy, openness, and some creativity. </p>

                <p>The internet operated that way for quite a few years. Slowly but surely, a few tech companies began
                    to realize the potential of monetizing the net. This too began to happen. In time a few big tech
                    companies essentially seized control of the internet and the web and transformed it into a
                    centralized totalitarian state with few freedoms.</p>

                <p>This web site is a protest against that.</p>

                <p>Several years ago I was talking with a friend and he said that "X, Y, and Z should happen and then
                    everything will be roses and unicorn farts. I was in a snarky mood that day and said something to
                    the effect that what needed to happen was that everyone needed to get a personal website, use RSS to
                    follow each other, and use email for communication and file transfers. Then, I said, everything will
                    be roses and unicorn farts.</p>

                <p>It took me a few years to realize the beauty of my snarky comment. It took me a while to see that it
                    was a decentralized system and that it was democratic, open, and would allow for creativity. Now I
                    am a believer and am putting my mouth where my money is.</p>

                <p>I will not try to explain all of the vision in this article. It will take me several articles to get
                    it all sorted out in my brain and written out for you. </p>

<description><![CDATA[<h3>Fonts</h3>
                <h6>Added <time datetime="2023-01-24">2023-01-24</time> </h6>

                <p>I learned a nifty little trick today. I have always though it would be a good idea to have the fonts
                    local. I kind of hate third party calls on the web. Somewhere in the back of my head I think that
                    everything pertaining to a webpage, like stylesheets, scripts, images, etc, should be on the local
                    device. You know, under the hood. A car doesn't need to send out for a carburetor after all. If it
                    did the car might be kind of on the slow side. I
                    might be wrong but I think this will speed up a page and maybe keep from pounding the internet so
                    hard. If that makes any sense.</p>

                <p>Anyway, the font for this page was found at <a
                        href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/glacial-indifference">Font Library.</a>
                    Yesterday, I noticed at the top right of the page that there was a download link for the fonts. Ok
                    COOL! Now what?!
                </p>

                <p>I ventured over to our beloved StackOverflow and found <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961721/how-do-i-install-a-custom-font-on-an-html-site">this
                        little
                        gem.</a></p>

                <p>Basically, all I did was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Download the zip file.</li>
                    <li>2. Created a "fonts" directory in the directory where my website lives</li>
                    <li>3. Unzip the downloaded file into the fonts directory</li>
                    <li>4. Added these lines to my CSS file (NOTE: the names and folder locations are specific to my
                        setup and fonts, probably not yours): <br>
                        <section class="code-block"> <code>@font-face {
                font-family: "GlacialIndifference";
                src: url('../fonts/GlacialIndifference/OTF/GlacialIndifference-Regular.otf');
                }
                <br>
                <br>
                @font-face {
                font-family: GlacialIndifference;
                font-weight: bold;
                src: url('../fonts/GlacialIndifference/OTF/GlacialIndifference-Bold.otf');
                }</code></section>
                    </li>
                    <li>5. Commented out the link in the header of my HTML file that allows the browser to go pick up
                        the font online.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After that, for grins and giggles I turned off the internet and checked to see if it worked. <em>IT
                        DID!</em></p>



                <p>I hace seen the "@something" tag in a couple of CSS files that I have perused but I didn't know what
                    it was for. Now I have a whole nuther rabbit hole Fonts]]>

<title>Day of Progress</title>

<description><![CDATA[<h3>A Day of Progress</h3>
                <h6>Added <time datetime="2023-01-22">2023-01-23</time> </h6>

                <p>Ok, so today has been a day of working on this webpage and I actually made some progress! I had a
                    glitch or two in my stylesheet that I couldn't figure out last night. Those issues are now resolved.
                    I also hated the way I had a pile of files meant to be this site so I got those organized in a way
                    that makes sense to me. Some minor league cosmetic things were changed along the way too.</p>

                <p>My big thing today though was learning a little about <abbr
                        title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and getting the feed written for this site.
                    Or, maybe I should say, written as far as the contents of this site will allow at this point.
                    Somewhere along the way I have written an RSS file before but it has been a long time. It is
                    actually much simpler than I remember and I now have a template for adding items to the feed.</p>

                <p>Every bit of this is being done by hand with a text editor. It is not that I am a glutton for
                    punishment, I want to do this the simplest way possible and I want to know all the ins-and-outs of
                    my own site. The text editor is the best way to do this. I should also add that this site lives on
                    my computer and is vetted before it is uploaded.</p>

                <p>This site will mostly consist of items that can be created and or manipulated in an editor. Because
                    this is a website it will only consist of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
                    </dfn> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript, <abbr
                        title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphic">SVG</abbr>
                    files.
                    HTML is the document itself. CSS files are used to make the document pretty. JavaScript is
                    programming language and is used for various purposes on a website. RSS is a way to distribute your
                    document without your readers having to view your site each day. SVG is a text created image.</p>

                <p>Easy peasy.</p>]]>
