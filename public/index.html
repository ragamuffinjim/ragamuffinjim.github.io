or so some people say. I have decided to start completely over with my web presence. I have scrapped the entire website/digital-garden that lived here and I am starting over from scratch. I am not making a single promise about anything regarding this project except that it will constantly be a work in progress.
</p>

<p>
Among the things that need to be done:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>add content (<b>DUH!</b>)</li>
<li>fix the styling to something pretty rather than easy</li>
<li>figure out things for a navigation bar</li>
<li>figure out if I want to have an RSS feed and how to implement it</li>
<li>get <a href="https://github.com/tanrax/org-social">Org-Social</a> up and running</li>
<li>and a host of other things that might be too trivial to mention at this point.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am glad that you stopped by and hope that you enjoy your visit. No, regrettably, there isn't much to see yet, but I am creating something new here so please be patient with my construction noise and debris.
</p>

Please feel free to <a href="mailto:ragamuffinjim@gmail.com">reply by Email</a>. I can be found on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ragamuffinjim">Mastodon</a> sometimes. I am working on setting up <a href="https://ragamuffinjim.github.io/social.org">Org-Social</a> after I upload this new page. On Matrix I am @ragamuffinjim:matrix.org I am not sure if there is a link for that.
