            <h2>27 April</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Angel called around 8PM. Tommie seems to have had a pretty good day. While everything that she has hurts
                and is uncomfortable she wanted to move around.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Talked to Angel around 11:30, Tommie seems to be doing ok so far today. Tommie had speech therapy this
                morning, I think is what she said. She seems stronger today and was moving around a little bit.</p>
            <p>They had a confab with the Doctor. Not sure of all the details, though he did mention that her brain is
                "exhausted" and that is when the aphasia rears up. He also said he usually suggests that patients have
                no visitors for at least a week.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>At 10AM I just received a message from my Angel saying "The doctor just said that restricting visitors is
                best for another week or so."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>This update was written around 8AM on 27 April.</p>
            <p>Well I don't know what to say about Tommie. On Wednesday she was moved to a rehab hospital to prepare her
                to return
                home. Since then the aphasia is back, especially when she is tired. The depression is still going
                strong. Of more
                pressing concern is the edema caused by her congestive heart failure combined with her laying in bed all
                the time. The
                edema is so bad that her skin is weeping. Since the fall needles are especially painful and traumatic
                for Tommie and we are trying to not have that sort of trauma. So having a nurse come into the room with
                a
                syringe to drain her was not a good thing.
                Another issue arose when they wanted to give her an high-powered diuretic called Lasix. The problem
                with that being
                that it would deplete her potassium to dangerous levels and she can't take the potassium pill. At the
                time she was not
                on an IV due to some other issues.</p>
            <p>Angel came home Wednesday and Thursday for a respite and all the above situation was going on. Angel
                returned
                last night and
                she found Tommie with an IV. The IV had the Lasix (the diuretic), Rocephin (a high-powered antibiotic),
                and some other
                stuff that I can't remember right now. Painkillers, I think.</p>
            <p>From the information that I am getting, it appears that Tommie has ups and downs. She goes to the
                therapy. She managed
                to walk twelve steps yesterday. \o/ But she tires easily and is in considerable pain.</p>
            <p><u><b>Visitation is now restricted.</b></u>
            <p>The family knows that you
                love
                Tommie and would
                like to see her but the family requests that you please call first before visiting. The visits are
                getting a little out
                of hand. There have been way too many people in the room at one time and she needs her rest and
                treatment. Please call
                before coming by and please realize that you may be turned away at the door. Her kids are doing their
                best to keep folks
                informed and relaying well wishes to Tommie.</p>
            <p>This is even true for us in-laws - I asked if I needed to go up to Lubbock today and I got a "Well, um,
                you can come up
                and take me to lunch but... um." It's ok Angel. I am not hospital material anyway. I can wait.</p>
            <p>The visitor restriction is especially true tomorrow, Sunday 28 April. Tommie starts her therapy sessions
                at 7AM tomorrow
                morning and they don't end until noonish. She will be zonked for the rest of the day.</p></u>
            <p>So here we are a week in. She is light years better than she was last Saturday but it feels like there
                are light years
                to go. Her kids are tired and they need a break. MC flew in yesterday and I am sure he is taking TC
                out
                of the
                situation for a bit this weekend. Angel came home Wed night and Thurs night. Not sure what all is going
                on with KM
                aside from the fact that I guess KT is driving up there everyday I guess to take care of KM. I
                think JB has an
                office in Lubbock so I am pretty sure he is still working just keeping to a loosey-goosey schedule.</p>

        <h2>19 April</h2>
        <article>
            <p>That is the update as of 22:47 on Friday 19 April.</p>
            <p>Ok, I am sorry to do this in a long impersonal form letter but I need to make this easier to do.</p>
            <p>The details that I have given about Tommie taking a fall are the essential facts. The stuff that I need
                to add to that
                are that she actually did fracture her skull and the gash in her head was closed with eight staples.</p>
            <p>Those facts are the "minor" problems in this case.</p>
            <p>Her brain was bruised in the fall and she has two blood clots. One in the front on one side and one in
                the back on the
                other. I can't remember if it was front left and back right or vice versa. I am processing a lot right
                now. One of the
                clots is small (I think Angel said the Docs said "tiny") and the other one is a little larger. Luckily,
                due to her
                advanced age her brain has begun to shrink which allows some space for the clots. This is the good news
                at this point
                and might be why she is still mostly alert and lucid. It will be different if the clots grow.</p>
            <p>So they are taking her off of a bunch of her prescription meds, like blood thinners, which she has been
                living on for
                many many years now. So there is a trade off on how much and what to give her and the risk of clots etc
                etc. and the
                risk of her other health issues rising up.</p>
            <p>The doctors want to keep her in the hospital and treat her with meds for now. Surgery in her case right
                now would be a
                high risk procedure. They are unwilling to drain off the clots at this time due to her fragile state.
                The doctors are
                saying that she will be in the hospital for a month to six weeks at least. If the clots become removable
                they may try to
                drain them then. This procedure will just require a couple of holes to allow the needles to go in. All
                the technical
                terms elude me at the moment.</p>
            <p>Angel and Tommie had a heart to heart and Tommie wants to fight until the kids thinks that it is not a
                good
                idea anymore. KM showed up in Lubbock while I was on the phone with her a few
                minutes ago.
                TC will be
                flying in in about an hour from Dallas. Not sure where JB and Mrs JB are. JB was in Bryan earlier
                today so I doubt
                he is back yet.</p>
            <p>Tommie is a strong ol' gal but she is 92 and the years are beginning to tell on her. I would really like
                to say that she
                will make it and I believe she probably can with the information that I have at present but she is
                getting
                tired.</p>
            <p>We have been thinking about a situation like this for years and prepping ourselves for it. We are sort of
                prepared but
                when something like this happens it still shocks us and we realize that we are not nearly as prepared as
                we thought.</p>
            <p>I will be going up to Lubbock tomorrow sometime. I am not sure what I can do besides bring Angel some
                clothes that she
                needs and maybe picking up lunch for the family or something.</p>
