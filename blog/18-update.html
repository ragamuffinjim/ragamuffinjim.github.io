            <p>It is hard to believe that the entire month of August has passed me by and I have not made a single
                update to this site. My life is in the midst of some serious chaos right now and I am having a tough
                time getting the swarm of information and changes processed and put in it's proper place. Some big big
                changes. I am kind of excited by some of aspects of it and terrified by other aspects of it. I might
                provide some details about the life changes happening as things get more concrete. Right now everything
                is imaginings and dreamland stuff.</p>

            <p>We spent the last week of July in southwestern Colorado. We had a good time. The weather was hot for that
                part of Colorado but was cool for us. We have spent nearly two months at temperatures of over 100
                degrees and a slight break from the heat was a blessing.
            </p>

            <p>I got another project in my mind for my furniture making hustle. An old timey album cabinet. I built
                something akin to this at work. It was a project that turned into a disaster. I think I figured out a
                way to make it better. In the near term I will be starting a side hustle where I hand build furniture
                out of wood and start selling it. Don't worry this site will not be all about me selling my wares. This
                will be my personal-about-anything webpage. I may draw out the plans and have some videos or something
                of me building the stuff though.</p>

            <p>Other than that not too much else is going on. I'll start making a better website here. I need life to
                calm down a little bit so that I can focus a lot better. Right now I feel like my world has been dumped
                out of a box and into a frying pan but things will level out sooner or later. </p>

            <p>Y'all have a good day now...</p>
