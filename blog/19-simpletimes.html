            <h2>Simple Times</h2>
            <p>Posted:<time datetime="2023-10-22"> 2023-10-22</time>
                <br>Currently reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)">A Beautiful
                    Mind</a> by Sylvia Nasar
                <br>Currently binging: James Bond movies
            </p>
            <p>So the other day I signed into an old Mastodon account that I never got around to deleting in my
                rage-quitting against (anti)social media a few months ago. It is actually getting to be fun now that I
                have eliminated all the people who have nothing but
                news/politics/religion/sexual-orientation/some-other-bullshit-idealistic reason for being on social
                media. It is nice to pare down the timeline to where it is people talking to people. I may stick around
                for a while. I was missing some of these folks and want to stay in touch.</p>

            <p>Parenthetically, after a disappointing day yesterday of trying to do something different with how I make
                this blog and RSS feed, I have decided that I will just keep doing what I am doing. It is easy and
                comfortable, kind of like and old shoe. After getting very little actually accomplished yesterday,
                except for the headache that comes from trying to relearn <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs">Emacs</a> and all of it's weirdness, I decided that
                what I was doing is working just fine and I will keep doing it.</p>

            <p>I will keep doing it the way I have been doing it with one or two provisos, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>- I will play in (anti)social media a little more with some very tight rules for me to follow.
                    (Manifesto coming soon)</li>
                <li>- I will clean out my RSS feed reader of the news and political stuff.</li>
                <li>- I will focus more on people in both my feed reader and social media accounts, and</li>
                <li>- I will actually take the time to turn this blog into something.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>I have also set a doohickey (please pardon the technical term) for sending the feed for this site to my
                Mastodon timeline. I found one person's blog through this sort of setup the other day and I really
                enjoyed his post. It was just a personal post about taking his kid to the barber. Nice, clean, simple,
                personal, and real.</p>

            <p><u>Nice, clean, simple, personal, and real.</u> Yeah, that is the internet that I want to be a part of.
                That is the internet that I want to see. That is the internet that I am, hopefully, helping to create.
            </p>
