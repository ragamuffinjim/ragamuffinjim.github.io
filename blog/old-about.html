            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>This project and webpage is the culmination of several years of practice, experimentation, and
                observation. In the late 80s I got an email account and I started sending emails back and forth to some
                family and friends and checking in on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet.</a> I did
                this on computers that friends let me use. Dialup was as slow as molasses and oftentime keeping up with
                email and Usenet was more of a chore than it was worth. I remember thinking at the time that this stuff
                would never take off. One had to be an egghead with amazing geek powers to make this stuff happen.</p>

            <p>Over the course of the next nearly 40 years I ran the entire gamut of the internet experience. From
                those
                days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes,</a> <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">forums,</a> email, and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">chatrooms</a> through <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Geocities</a> websites and the start of the
                downfall of the internet with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a> I played with
                almost everything that came along. Of course, after that came the evil empires of our current internet
                that have pretty much nailed the coffin on the open and democratic web.</p>

            <p>It has been several years ago now that I was one of a group of 10 to 15 people that signed up for
                every
                bleeding edging messaging thing that came along. We tried SMS, XMPP, ICQ, Matrix, Telegram, Signal,
                WhatsApp... You name it we probably tried it. A friend of mine commented at one point that we now have
                20 different ways to connect with ten different people. I remember thinking at the time that all of this
                really was overkill. Surely we could pare that list down to one or two.</p>

            <p>Around 2009 or so I became a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse.</a>
                By way of definition the <dfn id="federated universe"></dfn> <abbr
                    title="federated universe">Fediverse</abbr> is an amalgm of "federated" and "universe" and is
                roughly analagous to email. One can get an email on any server out there and it will exchange emails
                with any other server out there that it is capable of speaking with. The fediverse aims to do this with
                social media-type postings.</p>

            <p>The biggest problem is that it does not quite work as expected. Email is email no matter what
                particular
                service one uses. Every email service out there uses either IMAP or POP protocol for items coming in and
                SMTP protocol for stuff going out. THe fediverse is not that way. Every particular service has it's own
                unique protocol. Some are encrypted by default and some are not. Some have features A, B,and D only and
                other have only C, E, and F. One time one messed up setting on one server which was basically abandoned
                bound up the entire fediverse for a few days. So it was a rather regular thing for something to be
                messed up back in the day. We just grew to accept that there would
                be days that we would not hear from Hortence and JoeBob because there instance was not working properly.
            </p>

            <p>A couple of years ago something like this happened and one of my friends said that they wished
                such-and-such would happen because that would fix the situation. In my usual snarky manner I said
                something to the effect that I wished that everyone would go back to personal webpages, follow each
                other with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>, and use email for communication and file
                transfers. It is simpler. It will weed out the riffraff. It is open, democratic, and decentralized. I
                also think that it would cut out the divisive religious, political and sexual nonsense so prevalent in
                online social media. </p>

            <p>Everyone laughed and said "yeah, right! Jim you're full of poop." I sloughed it off. Yeah I am full
                of
                poop and something like this will never happen. Then on <time datetime="2023-01-16">16 January
                    2023</time> a post that I made on the one social media thing that I am still on went into the ether
                and no one (I guess) saw it. A contact of mine pointed out the error and here we go again!</p>

            <p>I decided that I have had enough. I want something that works. Why not try that crazy idea from a
                couple
                of years ago?</p>

            <p>I opened up my text editor and began sketching out the look of this page and got a layout that I
                liked
                and began typing out all sorts of blather that you may (or may not) read in the future. </p>

            <h3>This project</h3>

            <p>I know the reality- this is a project by <em>ONE</em> guy who is upset about what the social media
                world
                has done to the internet and the world and desires in some small way to return to a more open, more
                democratic, more free, and more artistic internet. I know that I am the lone lunatic baying at the sun
                at midnight.</p>

            <p>That being said I put a byline on this page that says <em>"by a Tinker and Thinker."</em> I
                "tinker" with
                the webpage and I only want to post longer and more thought out posts here than the drivel and memes in
                social media. I hope that other "Tinkers and Thinkers" may find this site and we can link up and help
                drive traffic to each other. Maybe. Who knows?</p>

            <p>For my part, my part of this project will consist of naught but the webpage, the RSS feed for this
                page,
                and my email. I plan to live this way for the next couple of months to see what happens. I may make one
                post on the one social media thing that I am still on about this project. Other than that I am done with
                the social media thing for a while.</p>

            <h3>This site</h3>

            <p>This webpage exists because I want a simpler, more free, more open, decentalized, and more
                democratic
                internet. </p>

            <p>This page is not necessarily a nostalgic site about the "good ol' days" of the internet though I do
                believe that things were better pre-social media.</p>

            <p>This webpage is a personal webpage. I do not represent anybody other than myself and I am not
                leading
                anything but myself to the dinner table.</p>

            <p>This is a personal webpage. I am not building a brand. I am not even sure what that
                means.</p>

            <p>This is a personal webpage. In the future there will be links where you can give me a donation or
                buy me
                something from my Amazon wishlist but this page is NOT about money.</p>

            <p>My intention is that after the first few "technical" and "philosophical" articles this webpage will
                be
                mostly my fictional writings and blatherings about mundane topics. This is, after all, a personal
                webpage.</p>

            <p>I will diligently strive to be non-political and non-religious on this webpage. There is much more
                to the
                world than that stuff.</p>

            <p>Ok on to some technical crap:

                <li>I will write out my own RSS feed for now. It will probably have errors until I figure
                    it all out.</li>

            <h3>This writer</h3>

            <p>Yes, this is a personal webpage but there really is not much to say about me. I am just a guy. I
                work, I
                wonder, and I write.</p>
