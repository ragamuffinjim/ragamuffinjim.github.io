                <p>I have been pondering where to host this website all day. I really want to avoid any entanglements
                    with big tech and this is a concern of mine. I imagine that any of the hosting providers out there
                    are beholden to one or more of the big tech companies out there. I do not want to sell out and take
                    the easy way out.</p>

                <p>I always wanted to have my own server. I mean one sitting on the desk beside me locally. It can not
                    be very difficult to run a simple file server. It just can't be. But I do not have a static IP
                    address so my address will always be changing. That creates an issue where I will need ot sign up
                    with a third party to handle the dynamic IP. This is sub par to me. I am also worried about security
                    issues when running a server.</p>

                <p>I wasn't wanting to go through the effort to get a domain name for this yet. I figure that in about 6
                    months I will be tired of playing with this website and be content to have it go away. If in six
                    months I find that I am still playing with it then I will decide on a domain name.</p>

                <p>So, I am not sure what to do. Using someone else's server is subpar but solves problems but it also
                    leads to me violating one of the ethical points of this project, namely sticking it to the man. I
                    would like the challenge of running a server but I am not sure of the value at this point.</p>

                <p>There will probably be more on this later.</p>
