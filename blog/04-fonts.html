                <h3>Fonts</h3>
                <h6>Added <time datetime="2023-01-24">2023-01-24</time> </h6>

                <p>I learned a nifty little trick today. I have always though it would be a good idea to have the fonts
                    local. I kind of hate third party calls on the web. Somewhere in the back of my head I think that
                    everything pertaining to a webpage, like stylesheets, scripts, images, etc, should be on the local
                    device. You know, under the hood. A car doesn't need to send out for a carburetor after all. If it
                    did the car might be kind of on the slow side. I
                    might be wrong but I think this will speed up a page and maybe keep from pounding the internet so
                    hard. If that makes any sense.</p>

                <p>Anyway, the font for this page was found at <a
                        href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/glacial-indifference">Font Library.</a>
                    Yesterday, I noticed at the top right of the page that there was a download link for the fonts. Ok
                    COOL! Now what?!
                </p>

                <p>I ventured over to our beloved StackOverflow and found <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961721/how-do-i-install-a-custom-font-on-an-html-site">this
                        little
                        gem.</a></p>

                <p>Basically, all I did was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Download the zip file.</li>
                    <li>2. Created a "fonts" directory in the directory where my website lives</li>
                    <li>3. Unzip the downloaded file into the fonts directory</li>
                    <li>4. Added these lines to my CSS file (NOTE: the names and folder locations are specific to my
                        setup and fonts, probably not yours): <br>
                        <section class="code-block"> <code>@font-face { 
	font-family: "GlacialIndifference"; 
	src: url('../fonts/GlacialIndifference/WEB/GlacialIndifference-Regular.woff2'); 
}
<br>
<br>
@font-face { 
    font-family: GlacialIndifference; 
    font-weight: bold; 
    src: url('../fonts/GlacialIndifference/WEB/GlacialIndifference-Bold.woff2');
}</code></section>
                    </li>
                    <li>5. Commented out the link in the header of my HTML file that allows the browser to go pick up
                        the font online.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After that, for grins and giggles I turned off the internet and checked to see if it worked. <em>IT
                        DID!</em></p>



                <p>I have seen the "@something" tag in a couple of CSS files that I have perused but I didn't know what
                    it was for. Now I have a whole nuther rabbit hole to plumb. </p>

                <p><em>Post Script:</em> Not sure why but the font reverts to TimesNewRoman on the Fastmail site. I
                    might move this over to github and see what it does there.</p>
