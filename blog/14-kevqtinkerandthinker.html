            <h2>Found another tinker and thinker!!!</h2>

            <p>What a delight it was today to find <a href="https://kevq.uk">Kev Quirk's website.</a> A five star work
                that one! He'll be going on the links page for sure.</p>

            <p>Kev has a computer job in InfoSec but, like me he has a small holding and tries to live a country life.
                We call our's a homestead and we try to do the same thing.</p>

            <p>He is the creator of <a href="https://simplecss.org">SimpleCSS</a> which I have used a time or two on
                some webpages.</p>

            <p>He also shares my disgust with the current state of (anti)social media and has opted to do the same thing
                about it that I have, namely leave it mostly in the dirt.</p>

            <p>Kev's site is definitely going into the feed reader and he is going to get a cheerful email to boot.</p>
