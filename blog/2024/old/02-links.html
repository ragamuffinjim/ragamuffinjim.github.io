                <h4>Blogroll or Other Tinkers and Thinkers</h4>
                <hr>

                <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/" class="linkspage" rel="nofollow">
                    <p class="index-block">David Marsden</p>
                </a>

                <p class="index-block">David Marsden has a wonderful personal blog that, in some small way, I hope to
                    emulate. Unfortunately, his feed is in a .json format and I don't have a reader that can read json
                    files.</p>

                <a href="https://kevq.uk" class="linkspage" rel="nofollow">
                    <p class="index-block">Kev Quirk</p>
                </a>

                <p class="index-block">Kev Quirk is the first in my links of other tinkers and thinkers! What a delight
                    it was to find his
                    site. He and I share several similarities including homesteading and antipathy towards (anti)social
                    media. Give him a read and follow his feed.</p>

                <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/" class="linkspage" rel="nofollow">
                    <p class="index-block">Manu Moreale</p>
                </a>

                <p class="index-block">I'll admit that what first attracted me to Manu's page was the sheer beauty of
                    the page. It is a beautiful site but as I read his posts I fell in love with the beauty of his words
                    too. A great site! It made it into my feed reader.</p>

                <a href="https://starbreaker.org/" class="linkspage" rel="nofollow">
                    <p class="index-block">Starbreaker</p>
                </a>

                <p class="index-block">Matthew Graybosch made it into my feed reader on the basis of one post alone. The
                    post is a critique of Zuck's Threads thingie and how he doesn't really give a shit about it. I put
                    him in the feed reader and then read other posts where he says many of the same things that I say
                    about (anti)social media, talks about being a a writer of science fiction, and just generally
                    displays his coolness.</p>

                <h4>Web Pages</h4>

                    <p class="index-block">The Web We Have To Save</p>
                </a>
                <p class="index-block">Written by the "Iranian Blogfather" this article inspired me to abandon social
                    media and go back to
                    a
                    simpler time and build a website.</p>

                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16792306/fcc-net-neutrality-open-internet-history-free-speech-anonymity"
                    class="linkspage" rel="nofollow">
                    <p class="index-block">We have abandoned every principle of the free and open internet</p>
                </a>

                <p class="index-block">An article about how the once open, decentralized, and democratic internet has
                    disappeared.</p>

                <h4>Email</h4>

                </a>
                <p class="index-block">Everybody gripes about it but it is probably the most stable communication
                    platform out
                    there.</p>
                <a href="https://useplaintext.email/" class="linkspage" rel="nofollow">
                    <p class="index-block">Use Plain Text Email</p>
                </a>
                <p class="index-block">In spite of my being in general agreement with the above link I do think a little
                    protection might
                    be
                    wise.</p>

                <h4>RSS</h4>

                </a>
                <p class="index-block">One of a couple of article that reminded me how cool RSS really is and that I
                    want to keep using
                    it.</p>
                <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/escape-the-algorithm/" class="linkspage"

                </a>
                <p class="index-block">Another good article that reminded me that it was time to dust off the feed
                    reader and get away
                    from
                    online social media.</p>
