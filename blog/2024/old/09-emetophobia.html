            <h2>Emetophobia</h2>
            <p>Ok, I really can not do a better job at this than the wikipedians so let me just quote some of their <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophobia">article:</a></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Emetophobia is a phobia that causes overwhelming, intense anxiety pertaining to vomit. This specific
                    phobia can also
                    include subcategories of what causes the anxiety, including a fear of vomiting or seeing others
                    vomit. Emetephobes
                    might also avoid the mentions of "barfing", vomiting, "throwing up", or "puking."</p>

                <p>It is common for those who suffer from emetophobia to be underweight or malnourished due to strict
                    diets and
                    restrictions they make for themselves. The thought of someone possibly vomiting can cause the phobic
                    person to engage in
                    extreme behaviors to escape from their anxiety triggers, e.g. going to great lengths to avoid
                    situations that could be
                    perceived as "threatening".</p>

                <p>Emetophobia is clinically considered an "elusive predicament" because limited research has been done
                    pertaining to it. The fear of vomiting receives little attention compared to other fears.</p>

                <p>The event of vomiting may make anyone with this peculiar phobia flee the scene. Some may fear other
                    people throwing up,
                    while others may fear themselves throwing up. Some may fear both. Some may have anxiety that makes
                    them feel as if they
                    will throw up when they actually might not. Other possible fears that may come with emetophobia is
                    not being able to
                    locate a restroom in a timely manner, not being able to stop throwing up, choking on vomit, being
                    embarrassed due to the
                    situation, or having to seek medical attention. People with emetophobia usually experience anxiety;
                    they often may
                    scream, cry, or if it is severe, pass out when someone or something has vomited.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The article goes on to show how emtophobia alters the lifestyle of the Emetophobes. Some have some
                complicated rituals like washing their food several times while they prepare it to avoid foodborne
                illnesses. As a result they do not go out to eat vey often.</p>

            <p>They are so afraid of vomit that they will not go to social situations where alcohol might be served. It
                says some women avoid pregnancy because they are afraid of the morning sickness of the first trimester.

            <p>Wow, parenthood must be a bitch for these folks.</p>
