                <bold>A note for the
                    meticulous:</bold><i> Yes I know the image above is off-centered and I know it is not detailed or
                    anything. It
                    is the result of a couple of hours of experimenting, learning, and playing. I am tired and decided
                    to just show off
                    rather than redraw it again.</i>
            </p>
            <p>I spent a couple of hours today playing with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG"><abbr
                        title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr></a> file.
                For those of you who do not know, svg files are images that can be edited in a text editor. SVG files
                are crisp and
                clean at any scale. The file above was created in a text editor and in the original iteration was
                somewhere between
                50 and 75 lines of code. </p>
            <p>Originally, everything was plotted out by starting a line at a point and
                ending it at another point. Long, boring, tedious and mind numbing was that procedure. If I had to draft
                cabinet
                plans that way all the time I might have to quit my job or take up heavy drinking.</p>
            <p>A few months ago
                when I started learning about SVG, or at least the syntax of it, I discovered the &lt;path&gt; element.
                I also
                discovered that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> is about as clear as mud on some
                things.
                While I did played around with &lt;path&gt; a few months ago I did not really understand much of what I
                was
                doing.</p>
            <p>I looked at my 60-odd lines of code today and said there simply has to be a better way to do
                this. So to Google I ventured and after a couple of other fruitless pages I found <a
                    href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-path-syntax-illustrated-guide/">this</a> wonderful page by Chris
                Coyier.
                About a 1/4 of the way down the page is a table that clearly explains in about 100 words what MDN
                couldn't explain
                in a few hundred words on their site.</p>
            <p>I experimented with <path> for a little while using the above
                    site as a reference. Low and behold one can use relative distances! I no longer need to go from
                    point x to point y
                    on every stinking line in the drawing. I can draw a whole plan relative to the point I started at.
                    That'll cut my
                    math down to NOTHING! </p>
            <p>At the end of it all today I probably can cut the time it takes to draw a
                cabinet in a text editor in half and my 60-odd lines of code was reduced to 24 lines AND 8 of those
                lines are
                comment lines and 2 more lines (the circles) are wholly unecessary. So, for what is in this picture
                there are only
                14 lines of code and that can be reduced as well.</p>
            <p>For those curious here is the code:
                <code class="code-block"><br>&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 232 232" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;<br>

                " fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" /&gt;<br>

                &lt;g stroke="black" fill="white" stroke-width="0.5"&gt;<br>

                &lt;!-- upper unit top --&gt;<br>

                &lt;path d="M 222 10 h -96 L 116.9 19.1 h 96 z" /&gt;<br>

                &lt;!-- backsplash --&gt;<br>

                &lt;path d="M 126 76 h 96 v -30 h -96 v 30" /&gt;<br>

                &lt;circle cx="222" cy="46" r="1" fill="red" /&gt;<br>
                &lt;circle cx="126" cy="76" r="1" fill="green" /&gt;<br>

                &lt;path d="M 126 76 l -16.97 16.97 h 96 l 16.97 -16.97" /&gt;<br>
                &lt;!-- front of cabinet --&gt;<br>
                &lt;path d="M 109.03 92.97 v 36 h 96 v -36 " /&gt;<br>
                &lt;!-- right side of cabinet --&gt;<br>
                &lt;path d="M 222 76 v 36 L 205.03 128.97 v -36 z" /&gt;<br>
                &lt;/g&gt;<br>
