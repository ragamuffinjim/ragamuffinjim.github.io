                <h3>Preface</h3>
                <p> The other day I wrote a rather long rant that was about the reasons why I am doing this. Upon
                    rereading it last night I came to the conclusion that it really is incoherent drivel. So I am
                    rewriting it right now. For those that happened to see the pre-production of this I apologize for
                    this but I need to write something better.</p>
                <h3>Main Event</h3>

                <p>The dream that was the internet has died. The internet was dreamed up to be a nuclear war proof
                    communication system for the government that was decentralized. Even if one node went down it would
                    still work. Civilians got ahold of it and added to the dream. The internet became not only a
                    decentralized communications network but a haven for democracy, openness, and some creativity. </p>

                <p>The internet operated that way for quite a few years. Slowly but surely, a few tech companies began
                    to realize the potential of monetizing the net. This too began to happen. In time a few big tech
                    companies essentially seized control of the internet and the web and transformed it into a
                    centralized totalitarian state with few freedoms.</p>

                <p>This web site is a protest against that.</p>

                <p>Several years ago I was talking with a friend and he said that "X, Y, and Z should happen in social
                    media and then
                    everything will be roses and unicorn farts. I was in a snarky mood that day and said something to
                    the effect that what needed to happen was that everyone needed to get a personal website, use RSS to
                    follow each other, and use email for communication and file transfers. Then, I said, everything will
                    be roses and unicorn farts.</p>

                <p>It took me a few years to realize the beauty of my snarky comment. It took me a while to see that it
                    was a decentralized system and that it was democratic, open, and would allow for creativity. Now I
                    am a believer and am putting my mouth where my money is.</p>

                <p>I will not try to explain all of the vision in this article. It will take me several articles to get
                    it all sorted out in my brain and written out for you. </p>

                <p>What you need to know for know is:
