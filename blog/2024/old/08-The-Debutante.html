            <h2>The Debutante</h2>
            <p>Let me just say "Wow!" here. <a
                    href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Debutante-Audiobook/B0BV13NMBK?eac_link=OmB41KBjRfwK&ref=web_search_eac_asin_1&eac_selected_type=asin&eac_selected=B0BV13NMBK&qid=Yen6kSpLkq&eac_id=147-2266999-2520525_Yen6kSpLkq&sr=1-1">The
                    Debutante</a> is an Audible podcast by Jon Ronson. It is the story of a Tulsa debutante's fall from
                society to neo-naziism in the timeframe of the Oklahoma City Bombing. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Howe">Carol Howe</a>, the debutante, was
                raised in the upper crust society of Tulsa Oklahoma and after high school she fell in with the wrong
                crowd and hung around with various high profile people in the white supremacist movement. She had ties
                to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim_City,_Oklahoma">Elohim City</a> and more than likely
                knew Timothy McVeigh prior to the OKC bombing.</p>

            <p>Somewhere along the way she became an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF)
                and may have provided the government with information of the planned terrorist act long before the
                events of 19 April 1995.</p>

            <p>Like everything in this type of study there are no definitive conclusions. She may have been a good guy
                acting like a bad guy to get info for the government. She may have been a bad guy stinging along
                everybody that ever came in contact with her. The ambiguity makes for good conspiracy theory copy.</p>

            <p>While I am not too sure what I think about Carol Howe this story is engaging and was a great listen once
                I got used to Ronson's bizarre accent. Also, I learned quite a bit that I didn't know about the OKC
                Bombing. It is one of those free-to-members things on Audible so give it a listen.</p>

            <p>EDITED: I had the wrong name for the debutante so I changed it and added a link to the wikipedia article
                about her.</p>
