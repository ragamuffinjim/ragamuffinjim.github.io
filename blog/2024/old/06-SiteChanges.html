            <h2>Site Changes</h2>
            <p>Life finally slowed down enough for me to spend some time on this site and get it out to the world.
                Truth
                is, that I probably had plenty of time to work on this site but I got sidetracked by other shiny
                toys
                like <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">Mastodon</a>.</p>

            <h3>Site Hosted on Github</h3>

            <p>I finally made a decision and put this site on the air! Yes, if you read some of the older posts on
                here
                you will discover that I wanted to avoid entanglements with evil comapnies in the big-tech world and
                wanted to host this on a server sitting on my desk at home. I still do.</p>

            <p>However, I simply do not have the time to mess with that right now. I wanted to get on with my
                experiment
                in simpler internetting and even simpler computing. I do not have to leave my text editor to post
                directly to github.</p>

            <p>I can hear a ton of people screaming in the background screaming about github now being owned by
                Microsoft. I know, I know, but really! I am a fat, half-deaf, half-blind guy approaching old age. I
                am a
                joke as a computer hacker or political malcontent. What threat am I to anybody? It will not take
                them
                long to get bored watching me.</p>

            <h3>Gemini</h3>

            <p>To tell the truth, I really like the idea of Gemini. It is so simple and unadorned that it really is
                beautiful. It follows my basic idea of everyone having a webpage, an RSS feed, and an email. Gemini
                is
                also a quieter place than the <abbr title="WorldWideWeb">WWW.</abbr> It is a little more laid back.
                A
                little more like me.</p>

            <p>I would rather just use Gemini because it is fun to use and the people there are great but it
                requires a
                browser of it's own and it is not all that easy for people with negligible computer skills to use. I
                can
                not see many of the people that I know <abbr title="In Real Life">IRL</abbr> ever joining the Gemini
                world. Most would rather be in
                Facebook land.</p>

            <p>I have decided to quit making things hard on myself and come back to <abbr
                    title="WorldWideWeb">WWW.</abbr></p>

            <h3>Mastodon</h3>

            <p>A very long time ago when I first got online I wanted to use the internet to become a famous writer.
                I
                did not understand how the "web" worked and kind of bounced around from one thing to another for
                quite a
                few years not really sure how to become famous online. Then the "social" media things appeared and I
                thought it was my ticket. I can put my writing in a blog and then use "social" media to promote it.
            </p>

            <p>Well, in my case "social" media became it's own cause in my life. My writing took a backseat to the
                online presence which took over my life. I would spend hours just maintaining my "social" media
                presence
                and wrote nothing of any value. As "social" media grew more toxic I began to retreat from it. I
                dropped
                all the big named services a few years ago but kept a couple of the smaller and geekier versions of
                them.</p>

            <p>One of those services was the Twitter-clone Mastodon. It has been a couple of years since I was very
                active on Mastodon. As I was getting this website online I thought, you know what, I need to post to
                my
                Mastodon posse that I am starting a website. I was thinking that doing that might get my website off
                to
                a good start and that I might be at least a little social online again.</p>

            <p>I got up this morning and took a good long look at Mastodon and came to the conclusion that I do not
                need
                to be involved in that nonsense. It is chock full of politics, religion, and the batshit crazy. It
                might
                be worse than the big named "social" services out there.</p>

            <h3>Back to Simplicity</h3>
            <p>So I am going back to the original idea of a webpage, an <abbr title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>
                feed, and email as a social platform.</p>
