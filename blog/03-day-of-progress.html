                <h3>A Day of Progress</h3>
                <h6>Added <time datetime="2023-01-22">2023-01-23</time> </h6>

                <p>Ok, so today has been a day of working on this webpage and I actually made some progress! I had a
                    glitch or two in my stylesheet that I couldn't figure out last night. Those issues are now resolved.
                    I also hated the way I had a pile of files meant to be this site so I got those organized in a way
                    that makes sense to me. Some minor league cosmetic things were changed along the way too.</p>

                <p>My big thing today though was learning a little about <abbr
                        title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and getting the feed written for this site.
                    Or, maybe I should say, written as far as the contents of this site will allow at this point.
                    Somewhere along the way I have written an RSS file before but it has been a long time. It is
                    actually much simpler than I remember and I now have a template for adding items to the feed.</p>

                <p>Every bit of this is being done by hand with a text editor. It is not that I am a glutton for
                    punishment, I want to do this the simplest way possible and I want to know all the ins-and-outs of
                    my own site. The text editor is the best way to do this. I should also add that this site lives on
                    my computer and is vetted before it is uploaded.</p>

                <p>This site will mostly consist of items that can be created and or manipulated in an editor. Because
                    this is a website it will only consist of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
                    </dfn> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript, <abbr
                        title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphic">SVG</abbr>
                    files.
                    HTML is the document itself. CSS files are used to make the document pretty. JavaScript is
                    programming language and is used for various purposes on a website. RSS is a way to distribute your
                    document without your readers having to view your site each day. SVG is a text created image.</p>

                <p>Easy peasy.</p>
