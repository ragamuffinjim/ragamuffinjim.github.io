                <h3>My digital garden</h3>
                <p>So for several months now I have wandering the innertubez searching for the perfect "blogging"
                    platform to use to put my writings online. I am not satisfied with any of them. People are beginning
                    to laugh at me for always moving around and changing where I post stuff. I bet some folk have ten
                    rss feeds all related to some idiotic thing that I have tried in the last couple of months.</p>
                <p>I think that I have finally figured out that I don't want to "blog" as much as I want a place online
                    for me to be me, a place where I can experiment with stuff, maybe do some coding, maybe do some
                    blogging. I am not sure what all will go in this digital garden but I am pretty sure that it will be
                    a seeming incoherent mess to someone who is not walking around in my head. </p>

                <p>This website will be about whatever I happen to be into at the time but here are the links to what is
                    here now:

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="whats-here.html">What is here?</a></li>
                    <li><a href="blog/02-links.html">Bookmarks</a></li>
                    <li><a href="chess/index.html">Chess</a></li>
                    <li><a href="esperanto/index.html">Esperanto</a></li>
                    <li><a href="woodwork/index.html">Woodworking</a></li>
                    <li><a href="vocab/vocab.html">Vocabulary Words</a></li>
                    <li><a href="blog/index.html">Blog</a></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
