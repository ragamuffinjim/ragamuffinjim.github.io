            <h2>Ok, so WTH are you doing now, Jim?</h2>
            <p>Well I really like blogging, sort of. Sometimes writing out a real blog can be a pain in the butt though.
                It requires a crap ton of work for very little reward. Especially if all that you are wanting is a
                glorified way of note taking or "Hey look at what I found online." I don't want to go into anything like
                Farcebork again, talk about a pain in the butt, so I came up with this idea. Why not just make a running
                webpage full of all sorts of crap? </p>

            <p>For example, I bump into all sorts of oddball crap online. Things that only nerds would even be
                interested in. I always thought that being a nerd was kind of distinguishing mark. Nowadays, however,
                nerds are fairly ubiquitous. Seems that everyone is a nerd of some sort. The question is what are they
                nerdy about. And as I travel down the highway it dawns on me that what makes one have a nerdgasm will
                probably give someone else a nerdgasm too.</p>

            <p>This is just going to be a fast and simple page of shit I find online or create myself. There will be no
                rss feed as I will probably be the only one to see it. There won't be much editing and there ain't going
                to be no damned politically correct shit in here. What you will see is what you're going to get. It will
                just be goofy stuff I either bump into or create.</p>

            <p>This is just for amusement. That being said let me issue this:</p>

            <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> Anyone dumb enough to take me seriously ought to have their heads examined before they
                seriously hurt themselves.</p>

                alt="Picture of a stone pot with a lid in The Plain of Jars World Heritage Site in Laos">
            <p>I got to looking at World Heritage Sites the other day. I have to admit a certain amount of
                American/Texan arrogance
                when I saw that the tiny county of Laos had three sites. How could such a tiny little country have so
                many sites? I
                thought to myself.</p>
            <p>Well, even though Laos is about the size of a thumbtack, it does give us a rather interesting World
                Heritage Site in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_of_Jars">Plain of Jars.</a> If I
                understand the story there is a huge field over in Laos that has a bajillion jars, like the one pictured
                above, all over the place. The eggheads have decided that these jars are where ancient folk buried their
                dead.</p>
            <p>Of course, I rather like the alternative explanation provided by legend of a race of giants occupying
                what we know of as Laos and these huge stone pots were for the making "huge amounts" of <i>"lau hai"</i>
                or rice wine.</p>

            <p>Now there is what is missing from the world- a race of giants getting smashed on homebrew!</p>

            <p>I suppose that to make this screed worthwhile I ought to provide something of educational merit once in a

                best defined as (straight from wiktionary):

                <li>(chiefly law) To compensate or reimburse someone for some expense or injury.</li>

                <h3>Wonder Woman</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Do you ever get to overpowering urge to smack some people upside the head and tell them to read a book
                once in a while? I have that urge just about every time I hear some one say something akin to "Back 40
                years ago we were more moral than today. The world is just falling apart." The merest hint of a phrase
                like that tells me that the person has NEVER read a book in their lives. They are claiming the moral
                high ground and yet they have obviously never read The Bible that they claim to cherish. By the by, for
                those who haven't partaken of the word, it is full of sex and violence and allusions to things we in
                polite society do not talk about.</p>
            <p>After watching the Gal Gadot movies in which she plays Wonder Woman I did a little bit of light reading
                on Wonder Woman. She was created by a dude named <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston">William Moulton Marston</a> in 1940. So
                we're talking 84 years ago. If people 40 years ago were more moral then twice that long back people
                must've been on the final step to heaven, right? Now Mr Moulton was married to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holloway_Marston">Elizabeth.</a> Now, the character
                Wonder Woman was based on a lady named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Byrne">Olive
                    Byrne,</a> who was their <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polyamorous"><i>polyamorous</i></a>
                life partner. William died in 1947 and Olive and
                Elizabeth continued living together until Olive died in 1990.</p>

            <p>Maybe I am a product of my time or something but as I read those those articles I am struck more by the
                fact
                that William died at the ripe old age of 54 than the polyamory. The women went on to live to 86 and 100.
                Hmm... makes a guy
                think that does.</p>

                <h3>Posting this from Phone</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Ok I can hear the oohs and ahhs in the background because, as the title of this post suggests, I actually
                am posting this time from my phone. It really is not that big of a deal, aside from the tiny screen on
                the phone. It would be an exercise in insanity if I didn't have an external bluetooth keyboard connected
                to the phone right now.</p>

            <p>I remember during COVID reading an article about three or four major motion pictures being filmed and
                edited on smartphones. Now that is impressive! On the TV show Only Murders in the Building our heroes
                are recording a podcast on their phones. That is slightly less awe inspiring than the films. Making a
                webpage on a cellphone is way down the list of impressive things that one can do on a smartphone. After
                all, a smartphone is just a computer with a phone attached and a webpage is really just a fancy text
                file. Granted some are fancier than others but this one is a pretty simple setup.</p>

            <p>I still want to hear all of the ooohs and ahhs because I might be a touch vain and self-serving so send
                in those oohs and ahhs. ;-)</p>

<a id=shogun"><h3>Shogun</h3></a>
<p>So I started watching the remake of the miniseries Shogun which is playing on Hulu right now. I remember watching the original starring Richard Chamberlain. That one was made in 1980. Luckily, aside from a couple of trivial things I remember very little of it.</p>

<p>That has made it easier for me to watch this one. So far, starting episode three, it has kind of grabbed me. I like the way the Japanese are speaking in Japanese throughout. It enhances Blackthorn's isolation and the mystery that Japan was at the time.</p>

<p>I have been fascinated by old Japan for a long time. While it is too early to tell if I like this show it has certainly grabbed my attention.</p>
