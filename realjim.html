            </a>
            <p>After a long hard day of work a farmer and his wife are sitting on the porch. Along about sunset they
                decide to go into the house and watch some TV. After scanning the TV guide channel the husband announces
                that all there is to watch are farming shows and porn and asks the Mrs which one she wants to watch.</p>
            <p>"Well," she says, "I guess, we'll watch porn. You already know how to farm."</p>

            <p>A 57 year old man who was bored with life and wife called his wife about quitting time one evening. He
                told his wife
                that he would not be home for dinner and in fact was going to a hotel with his 18 year old secretary. He
                informed the
                wife that he would not be home much before 11PM.</p>
            <p>The 57 year old wife responded by telling him: Ok, but just so you know, I have similar plans with my 18
                year old
                trainer. If you remember your elementary school math 57 goes into 18 only once. 18 goes into 57 quite a
                few times. So I
                won't be home much before dawn.</p>

                <h3>Why I don't use Apple Products.</h3>
            </a>
            <p>A guy that I know sincerely believes that Apple is a better computer. The hardware might be better I
                don't really know
                but the software is really just a proprietary version of an operating system known as BSD. BSD is in the
                UNIX/GNU-Linux/*nix family of OSes. I have been a Linux user since 2006 so please don't get me wrong-
                BSD is nice and
                for me it is easier to use than Windows but better? I don't know about that. All OSes pretty much do the
                same thing and
                for the most part in the same way. I can't help but feel that most Apple product users are only using
                Apple because it
                is more expensive and by extension they believe that more expensive equals better. In some areas Apple
                may be better but
                I doubt it in others.</p>
            <p>Another guy that I know 40 years ago refused to use Apple products because Apple did not have a "Control"
                key on their
                keyboard. He to this day refuses to use Apple for this reason. No matter how many times you tell him
                that a) the cmd key
                does the exact same thing that the ctrl key does so just use the cmd key and b) this ain't 1985 and
                hardly anyone these
                days uses keystrokes to navigate a computer anymore he still refuses to use Apple.
            </p>
            <p>Now my reason for not using Apple products is far more prosaic and is the only real reason to be against
                anything Apple-
                even after his passing 13 years ago Steve Jobs still gives me the creeps.</p>

                <h3>Women in Edo Era Japan</h3>
            </a>
            <p>With the help of Google Gemini</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The life of a Japanese woman in the Edo period (1603-1868) depended heavily on her social class. Here's a
                breakdown:</p>
            <h4>Upper Class Women (Samurai):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Limited Freedom:</b> Samurai women were expected to be well-educated and manage theLimited
                    Freedom: household. Their lives were restricted, with travel permits needed and male escorts often
                    mandatory.</li>
                <li><b>Education and Duty:</b> They received education in etiquette, arts, and sometimes even martial
                    arts to defend the household. Their primary duty was to support their husbands and raise strong
                    children who would uphold family honor.</li>
                <li><b>Appearance:</b> They wore elaborate silk kimonos and distinct hairstyles to signify marital
                    status. Blackened teeth
                    signified a married woman.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Lower Class Women (Merchants, Farmers):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hard Work:</b> Their lives revolved around hard work, supporting their families through farming,
                    crafts, or running small
                    businesses alongside their husbands.</li>
                <li><b>Less Restriction:</b> They had more freedom of movement compared to samurai women.</li>
                <li><b>Education:</b> Education was less common, with focus on practical skills needed for their work.
                </li>
                <li><b>Appearance:</b> Their clothing was simpler, made from cotton or hemp, reflecting their social
                    status.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Common Threads:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Subordination:</b> Regardless of class, women were expected to be subordinate to men, first to
                    their fathers and then to
                    their husbands.</li>
                <li><b>Arranged Marriage:</b> Love matches were rare. Marriages were arranged to strengthen family ties
                    or social positions.</li>
                <li><b>Geisha Culture:</b>Geisha Culture: The Edo period saw a flourishing of geisha culture. While not
                    all women became geisha, it offered some a
                    path to education in the arts and a chance to influence powerful men.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Entertainment vs. Reality:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ukiyo-e Woodblock Prints:</b> These popular prints often depicted idealized images of beautiful
                    women. They don't
                    necessarily reflect the daily lives of most women.</li>
                <li><b>Kabuki Theater:</b> Kabuki featured strong, independent female characters, but these were
                    portrayals, not everyday reality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, the Edo period was a time of strict social hierarchy for women. Their lives were centered around
                family and
                duty, with limited choices and freedoms. However, there were variations depending on social class, and
                glimpses of
                female agency can be found in cultural expressions of the time.</p>

            <p>I just got back from the grocery store. It was traumatic enough as I had figured that the store would be

                traumatic than the crowds...</p>
            <p>...Yoga Pants</p>
            <p>Forgive me, ladies, but somebody has to say it. Yoga pants are horribly unflattering to 95% of the women
                that wear them. It doesn't matter the body type, yoga pants are just ugly, unflattering, and
                unattractive. Most of us guys are embarrassed for you not turned on by your attire.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, cutoffs will catch the eye of just about everyone no matter what shape or size you

                <h3>A UFO, a Leprechaun, and a Goat</h3>
            </a>
            <p>By Google Gemini</p>
            <hr>
            <blockquote>Tell me a funny story about a farmer, a UFO, and a leprechaun riding a goat.</blockquote>
            <hr>
            <p>Farmer O'Leary, a stout, red-faced man with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, was known for his tall
                tales and
                outlandish stories. One fine summer evening, as he sat on his porch, puffing on his pipe and watching
                the sunset paint
                the sky in hues of gold and crimson, he decided to regale his neighbor, young Tommy, with one of his
                most fantastical
                yarns.</p>
            <p>"Tommy, lad," Farmer O'Leary began, his voice laced with a hint of brogue, "did you ever hear tell of the
                time I had a
                close encounter with a UFO, a leprechaun, and a goat?"</p>
            <p>Tommy's eyes widened in disbelief, his imagination already ignited by the prospect of such an
                extraordinary tale. "No,
                sir," he replied, his voice filled with eagerness. "Tell me, Farmer O'Leary, tell me!"</p>
            <p>Farmer O'Leary chuckled, his pipe smoke swirling around his head like a mischievous spirit. "Well, it was
                a night like
                this one, clear and starry, when I was out tending to my sheep. As I was walking through the fields, I
                saw a bright
                light in the sky, moving erratically. It grew closer and closer until it was hovering right above me. I
                was frozen in
                fear, not knowing what to make of it."</p>
            <p>"Suddenly, the light beamed down on me, and out stepped a creature I'd never seen before. It was small
                and green, with
                big pointy ears and a mischievous grin. I knew right away it was a leprechaun, a magical creature of
                Irish folklore."</p>
            <p></p>"The leprechaun hopped up and down, his tiny voice squeaking with excitement. 'Farmer O'Leary,' he
            said, 'I've come seeking your help. My home, the Land of Leprechauns, is under threat from a band of
            mischievous goblins. They're stealing our pots of gold and causing all sorts of havoc.'"</p>
            <p>"Well, I couldn't just turn my back on a creature in need, so I agreed to help. The leprechaun climbed
                onto my back, and
                we set off on a grand adventure to save the Land of Leprechauns."</p>
            <p>"As we journeyed through the night, we came across a field where a goat was grazing. The goat was no
                ordinary animal; it
                had a mischievous twinkle in its eye and a knowing glint in its stare. I knew right away it was no
                ordinary goat."</p>
            <p>"The goat approached us, its hooves clicking rhythmically on the ground. The leprechaun whispered in my
                ear, 'This goat
                is a magical creature, too. It can transport us to the Land of Leprechauns in the blink of an eye.'"</p>
            <p>"I was hesitant at first, but the leprechaun's urgency convinced me. We climbed onto the goat's back, and
                with a leap,
                we were whisked away to the Land of Leprechauns."</p>
            <p>"The Land of Leprechauns was a sight to behold. Rolling hills dotted with shamrock clover, rainbow
                bridges spanning
                sparkling rivers, and tiny cottages nestled amidst lush greenery. But the goblins had wreaked havoc,
                leaving a trail of
                destruction in their wake."</p>
            <p>"With the help of the leprechaun and the magical goat, we rallied the leprechauns and drove back the
                mischievous
                goblins. The Land of Leprechauns was saved, and the leprechaun thanked me profusely for my bravery and
                kindness."</p>
            <p>"As a reward, the leprechaun led me to a hidden pot of gold, buried deep in the heart of the Land of
                Leprechauns. I
                filled my pockets with glittering coins, and with a grateful heart, I bid farewell to my newfound
                friends."</p>
            <p>"The magical goat transported me back to my farm, where I found myself standing in the same field, the
                moonlight casting
                long shadows across the land. I looked up at the sky, but the UFO had vanished. The leprechaun and the
                goat were gone,
                but the memory of their adventure would forever be etched in my mind."</p>
            <p>Tommy sat wide-eyed, his imagination captivated by Farmer O'Leary's fantastical tale. He knew Farmer
                O'Leary had a
                reputation for embellishing his stories, but this one, with its leprechauns, UFOs, and magical goats,
                was truly out of
                this world.</p>

            <hr>
            <p><i>Forgive me for being a late bloomer on this but, to tell the total truth, I have lost a lot of my

                    few weeks ago. My steps into that realm were more out of curiosity than any desire to learn AI or to
                    use it.</i></p>

            <p><i>I asked Google's AI, called Bard or maybe Gemini, to tell me about the Pharisees. Here are the
                    results.</i></p>
            <p><i>Please note that I can neither confirm nor deny the truth or factualness of what it came up with but

            <hr>
            <p>The Pharisees were a powerful and influential Jewish religious group that existed during the Second
                Temple period, from
                roughly the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. The word "Pharisee" comes from the Hebrew word
                "perushim," which
                means "separated ones." This name likely refers to the Pharisees' separation from other Jewish groups,
                such as the
                Sadducees and the Essenes, based on their distinct religious beliefs and practices.</p>
            <h4>Beliefs and Practices</h4>
            <p>The Pharisees were known for their emphasis on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Oral tradition:</b> In addition to the written Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible),
                    the Pharisees also placed a
                    high value on oral tradition, which they believed was passed down from Moses to later generations.
                    This oral tradition
                    included interpretations of the Torah, as well as additional laws and regulations that were not
                    explicitly mentioned in
                    the written text.</li>
                <li><b>Personal piety:</b> The Pharisees believed in the importance of personal piety and living a life
                    that was faithful to God's
                    law. They emphasized the importance of prayer, studying the Torah, and observing religious rituals.
                </li>
                <li><b>Universal observance of Jewish law:</b> The Pharisees believed that all Jews, not just priests or
                    the wealthy, were
                    obligated to observe Jewish law. They developed a complex system of interpretation and application
                    of Jewish law that
                    applied to all aspects of daily life.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Legacy</h4>
            <p>After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Pharisees emerged as the dominant religious
                force in Judaism.
                Their beliefs and practices formed the foundation of Rabbinic Judaism, which continues to be the
                dominant form of
                Judaism today.</p>
            <p><b>It's important to note that the portrayal of the Pharisees in the New Testament is often negative, and
                    they are
                    frequently depicted as being critical of Jesus and his teachings.</b>However, it is important to
                remember that these
                portrayals were written by early Christians who may have had their own biases against the Pharisees.
                Modern scholars
                caution against relying solely on the New Testament for an accurate understanding of the Pharisees and
                their beliefs.</p>
            <p>Here are some additional points to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Pharisees were not a monolithic group, and there was diversity of thought and practice within
                    the movement.</li>
                <li>The Pharisees played an important role in preserving Jewish culture and tradition during a time of
                    political and social
                    upheaval.</li>
                <li>Their emphasis on education and interpretation of Jewish law helped to lay the foundation for
                    Rabbinic Judaism.</li>
            </ul>

            <a id="laundromat-con">
                <h3>Laundromat Congame</h3>
            </a>

            <p>So I woke up about 7 this morning and slowly went about the business of getting awake and moving and
                thinking about what I want to get done today. I didn't even leave the house yesterday and barely even
                left the office. I told myself that I needed to behave and get some chores done before I vegged out on
                Shogun or whatever else I found on the TV. </p>
            <p>All the laundry was gathered and taken to the laundry room and I fired up the washer and nothing. The
                washer has needed some repairs and last weekend it started acting rather goofy. It stopped a couple of
                times in the middle of it's cycle. When I went in to check on it and found that it wasn't working. I
                fiddled with the knobs and gave it a good swift kick and it fired back up. Well today nothing.</p>
            <p>As I was alone most of last week my laundry duty is light. I texted Angel and told her the situation and
                then decided that all I had was 1 or 2 loads so I would just go to a laundromat and wash them and then
                bring them home to dry. I loaded up the laundry and grabbed a crapton of quarters from the coin bucket
                and aimed out.</p>
            <p>Guess what, laundromats don't take quarters anymore! You now have to go to this kiosk and slip money into
                it and it gives you this laundry card that you can use to pay for your washing. Well, aside from doing
                laundry when we are camping in Colorado (which still uses coinage) I haven't been in a laundromat in
                years. I have no idea what they charge for laundry. I am seeing prices on some of the machines and they
                range from around $5 all the way up to $8 or so. I start feeding $1 bills into that machine until I run
                out of them. This card costs you a dollar to start with so I think I put $9 in the machine total.</p>
            <p>I spent $9. The washing cost me $5.25. There was a $1 charge for getting the card. The balance on the
                card right now is $2.75. That is $3.75 that I will probably not ever get back seeing we will get a new
                washer when the mother-in-law is out of the hospital.</p>
            <p>What a damned rip-off. Firstly, $5 a wash is a ridiculous price anyway and then add the service fee and
                left over balance on top of that! </p>
            <p>And think about the people that are going to the laundromat! These are mostly poor people who can't
                afford to lose any money, much less 1/2 of the cost of a load.</p>
            <p>When are we going to quit raping each other and start charging fair prices for crap that ain't going to
                last and end hidden fees. Let's go back to cash and privacy.</p>
            <p>Let's end the flipping greed. We are somewhere in the middle class and we can't afford to live anymore.
                It's not Biden, or Trump, or homosexuality that is going to destroy this country. It is our damned greed
                and us stupidly paying for shit that is really just theft.</p>
            <p>I think I am ready to tell the whole world to go to hell. We are living ridiculous lives only to enrich
                greedy fatcats. It has to stop.</p>

            <h2>Ok, so WTH are you doing now, Jim?</h2>
            <p>Well I really like blogging, sort of. Sometimes writing out a real blog can be a pain in the butt though.
                It requires a crap ton of work for very little reward. Especially if all that you are wanting is a
                glorified way of note taking or "Hey look at what I found online." I don't want to go into anything like
                Farcebork again, talk about a pain in the butt, so I came up with this idea. Why not just make a running
                webpage full of all sorts of crap? </p>

            <p>For example, I bump into all sorts of oddball crap online. Things that only nerds would even be
                interested in. I always thought that being a nerd was kind of distinguishing mark. Nowadays, however,
                nerds are fairly ubiquitous. Seems that everyone is a nerd of some sort. The question is what are they
                nerdy about. And as I travel down the highway it dawns on me that what makes one have a nerdgasm will
                probably give someone else a nerdgasm too.</p>

            <p>This is just going to be a fast and simple page of shit I find online or create myself. There will be no
                rss feed as I will probably be the only one to see it. There won't be much editing and there ain't going
                to be no damned politically correct shit in here. What you will see is what you're going to get. It will
                just be goofy stuff I either bump into or create.</p>

            <p>This is just for amusement. That being said let me issue this:</p>

                alt="Picture of a stone pot with a lid in The Plain of Jars World Heritage Site in Laos">
            <p>I got to looking at World Heritage Sites the other day. I have to admit a certain amount of
                American/Texan arrogance
                when I saw that the tiny county of Laos had three sites. How could such a tiny little country have so
                many sites? I
                thought to myself.</p>
            <p>Well, even though Laos is about the size of a thumbtack, it does give us a rather interesting World
                Heritage Site in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_of_Jars">Plain of Jars.</a> If I
                understand the story there is a huge field over in Laos that has a bajillion jars, like the one pictured
                above, all over the place. The eggheads have decided that these jars are where ancient folk buried their
                dead.</p>
            <p>Of course, I rather like the alternative explanation provided by legend of a race of giants occupying
                what we know of as Laos and these huge stone pots were for the making "huge amounts" of <i>"lau hai"</i>
                or rice wine.</p>

            <p>Now there is what is missing from the world- a race of giants getting smashed on homebrew!</p>

                <h3>Wonder Woman</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Do you ever get to overpowering urge to smack some people upside the head and tell them to read a book
                once in a while? I have that urge just about every time I hear some one say something akin to "Back 40
                years ago we were more moral than today. The world is just falling apart." The merest hint of a phrase
                like that tells me that the person has NEVER read a book in their lives. They are claiming the moral
                high ground and yet they have obviously never read The Bible that they claim to cherish. By the by, for
                those who haven't partaken of the word, it is full of sex and violence and allusions to things we in
                polite society do not talk about.</p>
            <p>After watching the Gal Gadot movies in which she plays Wonder Woman I did a little bit of light reading
                on Wonder Woman. She was created by a dude named <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston">William Moulton Marston</a> in 1940. So
                we're talking 84 years ago. If people 40 years ago were more moral then twice that long back people
                must've been on the final step to heaven, right? Now Mr Moulton was married to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holloway_Marston">Elizabeth.</a> Now, the character
                Wonder Woman was based on a lady named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Byrne">Olive
                    Byrne,</a> who was their <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polyamorous"><i>polyamorous</i></a>
                life partner. William died in 1947 and Olive and
                Elizabeth continued living together until Olive died in 1990.</p>

            <p>Maybe I am a product of my time or something but as I read those those articles I am struck more by the
                fact
                that William died at the ripe old age of 54 than the polyamory. The women went on to live to 86 and 100.
                Hmm... makes a guy
                think that does.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Ok I can hear the oohs and ahhs in the background because, as the title of this post suggests, I actually
                am posting this time from my phone. It really is not that big of a deal, aside from the tiny screen on
                the phone. It would be an exercise in insanity if I didn't have an external bluetooth keyboard connected
                to the phone right now.</p>

            <p>I remember during COVID reading an article about three or four major motion pictures being filmed and
                edited on smartphones. Now that is impressive! On the TV show Only Murders in the Building our heroes
                are recording a podcast on their phones. That is slightly less awe inspiring than the films. Making a
                webpage on a cellphone is way down the list of impressive things that one can do on a smartphone. After
                all, a smartphone is just a computer with a phone attached and a webpage is really just a fancy text
                file. Granted some are fancier than others but this one is a pretty simple setup.</p>

            <p>I still want to hear all of the ooohs and ahhs because I might be a touch vain and self-serving so send
                in those oohs and ahhs. ;-)</p>

                <h3>Shogun</h3>
            </a>
            <p>So I started watching the remake of the miniseries Shogun which is playing on Hulu right now. I remember
                watching the original starring Richard Chamberlain. That one was made in 1980. Luckily, aside from a
                couple of trivial things I remember very little of it.</p>

            <p>That has made it easier for me to watch this one. So far, starting episode three, it has kind of grabbed
                me. I like the way the Japanese are speaking in Japanese throughout. It enhances Blackthorn's isolation
                and the mystery that Japan was at the time.</p>

            <p>I have been fascinated by old Japan for a long time. While it is too early to tell if I like this show it
                has certainly grabbed my attention.</p>
