            <h2>Ok, so WTH are you doing now, Jim?</h2>
            <p>Well I really like blogging, sort of. Sometimes writing out a real blog can be a pain in the butt though.
                It requires a crap ton of work for very little reward. Especially if all that you are wanting is a
                glorified way of note taking or "Hey look at what I found online." I don't want to go into anything like
                Farcebork again, talk about a pain in the butt, so I came up with this idea. Why not just make a running
                webpage full of all sorts of crap. </p>

            <p>For example, I bump into all sorts of oddball crap online. Things that only nerds would even be
                interested in. I always thought that being a nerd was kind of distinguishing mark. Nowadays, however,
                nerds are fairly ubiquitous. Seems that everyone is a nerd of some sort. The question is what are they
                nerdy about. And as I travel down the highway it dawns on me that what makes one have a nerdgasm will
                probably give someone else a nerdgasm too.</p>

            <p>This is just going to be a fast and simple page of shit I find online or create myself. There will be no
                rss feed as I will probably be the only one to see it. There won't be much editing and there ain't going
                to be no damned politically correct shit in here. What you will see is what you're going to get. It will
                just be goofy stuff I either bump into or create.</p>

            <p>This is just for amusement. That being said let me issue this:</p>

            <p><b>DISLCAIMER:</b> Anyone dumb enough to take me seriously ought to have their heads examined before they
                seriously hurt themselves.</p>

            <p>I got to looking at World Heritage Sites the other day. I have to admit a certain amount of
                American/Texan arrogance
                when I saw that the tiny county of Laos had three sites. How could such a tiny little country have so
                many sites? I
                thought to myself.</p>
            <p>Well, even though Laos is about the size of a thumbtack, it does gives a rather interesting World
                Heritage Site in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_of_Jars">Plain of Jars.</a> If I
                understand the story there is a huge field over in Laos that has a bajillion jars, like the one pictured
                above, all over the place. The eggheads have decided that these jars are where ancient folk buried their
                dead.</p>
            <p>Of course, I rather like the alternative explanation provided by legend of a race of giants occupying
                what we know of as Laos and these huge stone pots were for the making "huge amounts" of <i>"lau hai"</i>
                or rice wine.</p>

            <p>Now there is what is missing from the world- a race of giants getting smashed on homebrew!</p>

            <p>I suppose that to make this screed worthwhile I ought to provide something of educational merit once in a
                while. So here is the word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indemnify">indemnify.</a> Probably
                best defined as (straight from wiktionary):
            <ul>
                <li>To secure against loss or damage; to insure.</li>
                <li>(chiefly law) To compensate or reimburse someone for some expense or injury.</li>
