                <br>Currently reading:Death Come for the Archbishop by Willa Cather
                <br>Currently binging: X-Files
                <br>Current music genre: Fifty Shades movies soundtracks
            </p>
            <p>Truth is that this is just a test post to see if I can do something. Github has pissed me off in that it's runners or something don't work for crap and so my org-to-blog setup is not working on THEIR end and I am frankly sick of trying to figure out where it is broken there. It workd like a champ here. This is too complicated for what I am doing so I am going back to the templates and fill in the blanks set up that I used to use. Too hell with all of that other drivel.</p>
